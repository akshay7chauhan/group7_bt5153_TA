All part of the price of establishing a world-class subway system. The Botanic Gardens however, are a huge green oasis, bequeathed to us by generations for foresightful individuals and governments. Strolling, jogging, walking the dog, or however, the Gardens are refreshingly peaceful clean and green, a place to relax, reflect, and admire some of the wonders of nature. Watch the fish at Swan Lake, watch or participate in the morning Tai Chi and exercise sessions. Join a fitness boot camp. Enjoy a drink or meal at one of the several cafes and restaurants.

650616788,2019-02-07 00:00:00.000,5,A Jungle At Your Doorstep,"A Casualty of War: There was a time, not that very long ago, when whatâ€™s now Orchard Road was pristine jungle, and salt-water crocs slithered up the riverbank where Clarke Quay now stands. But as jungles go in Singapore, most of them have packed and gone. Bukit Timah is the last real hilltop jungle left, but itâ€™s no match for the ancient jungles you can still find in Borneo, New Guinea, and other undisturbed places. Less than 80 years ago, Bukit Timah itself was very disturbed: by tanks, artillery barrages, dive bombers and mortars. In little more than 12 hoursâ€”from dusk on 10 February 1942 to dawn the next morning, the Battle of Bukit Timah laid waste to what had been the most pristine bit of highland jungle Singapore had. By 0800 on 11 February, Bukit Timahâ€™s ecosystem was shell-shocked and critically wounded. And then, for another three decades, the bukit was subjected to additional stresses, such as unrestricted vehicle traffic._x000D_
_x000D_
Recovery: Not all the old trees were destroyed, and some saplings that sprang up over the next decades are now mature. But donâ€™t expect a pristine, climax tropical rain-forest. In Sumatra, weâ€™ve been through jungle with a canopy so dense that the floor was sunless and gloomy at high noon on a cloudless day. The canopy is still patchy at Bukit Timah (see Canopy Gaps photo); perhaps in another 20 or 50 years.... Still, Bukit Timahâ€™s jungle is seven years older than the first time I saw it, and looks a bit denser, perhaps._x000D_
_x000D_
Convenience: On the other hand, this is the best upland jungle that Singaporeâ€™s got, and the fact that Singaporeâ€™s got it, rather than Sarawak or Sumatra, means that itâ€™s considerably more accessible. Itâ€™s at your doorstep (literally so, if you live in an apartment at the bottom of the bukit). Instead of spending three days reaching remote jungles up-country from Kuching or Medan, you can start hiking up Bukit Timah at high noon and be back down again by tea-time._x000D_
_x000D_
Ease of Ascent: Bukit Timah, as a pedestrian stroll, is much improved since seven years ago, when hikers climbed up (and even more carefully down) a steep and deeply-rutted dirt trail that was treacherous when dry and homicidal when wet. Nowadays theyâ€™ve got a well-engineered hiking path taking you up the bukit, and proper stairs with hand-ropes no less, all far safer than the former accommodations. The summit of Bukit Timah is the highest point in the entire country, but at 164 meters (538 ft), this trek is still easier than a steep climb up to the nightâ€™s camp-ground in the Alps of Switzerland, the Andes of Peru, or the auberges of Paris when their lift is out of order as usual. (However, Iâ€™ll qualify that with some cautions at the end of my review.)_x000D_
_x000D_
Animals: The tigers of Bukit Timuh, a terror in the mid-1800s, have long since been eradicated, but pythons, pangolins and flying colugos are still up on the bukit, somewhere, as are a variety of birds such as barbets and bulbuls. In my visits to Bukit Timah, Iâ€™ve heard birds far more often than Iâ€™ve spotted them, and never encountered most of the animal species that are up there. Except macaques. On a few rare occasions, Iâ€™ve found macaques; but normally they always find me first. The macaques have turned brazen due to humans feeding them. Theyâ€™re not domesticated, but their independent jungle self-sufficiency appears to be waning, while their hooliganism is waxing. I suspect the timid and skittish ones are youngsters still learning the ropes. If your primary goal is to see lots of Southeast Asian jungle animals, head to Singapore Zoo; their cousins are rather shy and retiring up on the bukit._x000D_

The Song of the Jungle: With luck, within a few minutes walk from the Visitor Centre, youâ€™ll be surrounded by the primordial music of the jungleâ€”the song of the cicadas.

This is the price to access the domes, so we chose not to do so as one was closed for maintenance. However, as a group, we paid $8 each and walked the Skyway.

Old court rooms and holding cells as well as the modern architecture drawing two colonial buildings together. Tip from a local is to go back there after 4pm as there is a bar on the roof top where you get a panoramic view of Singapore (I'm trying that next time)._x000D_

_x000D_
I have however some feedback for management._x000D_
_x000D_
I usually never watch a zoo ""show"" as i believe that the shows are awful and dont like the animals to be trained for human entertainment. Yes i know that from the managements's point of view, the animals are just doing what they would do in nature. I still stand by my point of view and rather not watch a circus show in the zoo._x000D_
I sat in 2 shows however in the last 3 weeks because i brought visitors from overseas to the zoo. I could hardly listen to what the host was saying as they speak so fast and in such a bad tone that one is unable to listen to what they are saying. The speakers are also outdated and one is able to hear the commentary but its not clear to listen to. Perhaps management needs to invest in better digital speakers. Management should also record the commentary of the host at the shows and play it back to them to see if the host follow and understand what they are saying. I spoke to a host after the show about the commentary and she said nobody really listens anyway and shrugged me off as a silly tourist._x000D_
_x000D_
The only time u get attention from a staff member is when they annoyingly try and take pictures of you and sell you the same afterwards. Most tourist and people visiting these attractions usually have their own cameras and annoying selfie sticks with flash taking their own pictures. Why have your staff ""crying"" out annoyingly to sell a photograph._x000D_
Its sad that this once amazing animal sanctuary attraction is now nothing more than a money spinning business._x000D_
_x000D_
Perhaps some improvement on the signage of animals and more educative information as well. Not much to read about the animals._x000D_
_x000D_
A question for management, why is ticket booth signage translated only into chinese? and not any other language. Are tourist from other countries not good enough for your business? Singapore is an English speaking country and english is a universal language and i do believe that signage should be only in english in singapore. Perhaps i am wrong.",2016-07-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-26 12:18:40.867,Jasjhol,South Africa,Singapore Zoo,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",zoo absolutely beautiful stun set open pocket natural setting great get away noise cityxd xd however feedback managementxd xd usually never watch zoo show believe show awful dont like animal train human entertainment yes know management point view animal would nature still stand point view rather not watch circus show zooxd sat show however last week brought visitor overseas zoo could hardly listen host say speak fast bad tone one unable listen say speaker also outdated one able hear commentary not clear listen perhaps management need invest well digital speaker management also record commentary host show play back see host follow understand say spoke host show commentary say nobody really listens anyway shrug silly touristxd xd time u get attention staff member annoyingly try take picture sell afterwards tourist people visit attraction usually camera annoy selfie stick flash take picture staff cry annoyingly sell photographxd sad amaze animal sanctuary attraction nothing money spin businessxd xd perhaps improvement signage animal educative information well not much read animalsxd xd question management ticket booth signage translate chinese not language tourist country not good enough business singapore english speak country english universal language believe signage english singapore perhaps wrong

This is a massive greenhouse called the Cloud Forest. We entered this when it was already getting dark, and therefore couldnâ€™t appreciate the flowers as well as we perhaps would have been able to had we reached during daylight hours._x000D_
_x000D_
The first sight that greets you when you enter is a high waterfall (the tallest indoor one in the world). From beyond this, elevators rise several stories to the top, bringing you out at the top of the waterfall. Here, once youâ€™ve admired the view from the top, you can start going downâ€”through a series of walkways that coil around the â€˜mountainâ€™ that forms the basis of the forest. At each level, there is some explanatory text to show how rainforests survive and what they consist of, what are their features, and so on. More than that, of course, there are the plants and trees themselves. Orchids, especially, are in profusion here._x000D_
_x000D_
Among the noteworthy sections in the Cloud Forest are the Crystal Mountain (which showcases crystals, the mining of which is a factor in the decimation of rainforests) and the Secret Garden, which is a recreation of a Jurassic era landscape, including miniature orchids so tiny that they are displayed behind carefully placed magnifying glasses!_x000D_

However, it is at night and some animals are difficult to see or are timid obviously, although a tapir walked right past us!! They are animals though, it's always going to be random of how it is._x000D_
_x000D_
It's difficult to say what I made of it. You can see there nocturnal animals and they are great but pics are near impossible unless using a top of the line slr so sitting back and enjoying the ride is good. They take you around on these coach/buggie things and you can get off to walk bits if you want._x000D_

There is also a show where the trainers demonstrate some of the animals traits and skills in an informative way. This was very very good._x000D_
_x000D_
My advice;_x000D_
It opens at 7:30 if I remember and is near the river safari it's well sign posted. Turn up early, we turned up at 7 and the queue was the length of the courtyard which is huge. The staff are great at getting a lot of people through but be prepared to wait a while if you're not willing to stand in line for so long._x000D_
_x000D_
Also the food is mega expensive at the zoo. Bring your own and drinks if you can._x000D_
_x000D_
On finishing the night safari we needed a taxi back. From doing this twice it is important if you don't want to queue for ages then sit at the back of the show so you're first out and then walk quick to the rank near the entrance. There will be a lot but there are also loads of people coming out at the same time too._x000D_

Having just come from China on this trip and staying at a Hyatt, I would have to say this was a negative. When you are spending this much per night, I would expect a quality pillow, not a budget one. As you spend almost a 3rd of your day sleeping, this is a key part of a 4 star rating for me seeing as I am spending a week and did not bring my own pillow from home.

482994896,2017-05-09 00:00:00.000,5,Excellent zoo,"My wife and I took a taxi to Singapore zoo in a premium taxi from the Intercontinental in Bugis early on a Sunday morning and it took c. 20 mins and cost $25 (note the return in a normal taxi was $21.50). _x000D_
_x000D_
We had pre-booked tickets online and had printed copies which saved time. We arrived at 8.15am. Park entry opened at 8.30am and we made our way to Breakfast with Orangutans at Ah Meng restaurant (cost $35 per person with payment on entry, cards accepted). Breakfast was of very average quality (when compared to the 5* hotels weekend staying in but was edible). However, the opportunity to get up close to the orangutans (they come out 9.30am-10am) is really what you're paying for. You can take photos while they sit on their perch eating their breakfast and then there is the opportunity for you to have your photo taken with them.  (Note that your photo is first taken by the zoo photographer and you can pay silly money to have it printed out but there is a second who will take a picture with your own camera). The experience is not as intimate as depicted on the website but there must have been approx 140 people there. Nevertheless, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. I didn't take comparable quality photos seeing them in their activity area later on in the day. _x000D_
_x000D_
The rest of the day we explored the rest of the zoo. We went to the sea lion show at 10.30am and sat towards the front. We had a great view. Note you will get wet if you sit in the blue benches in the first two rows. The show was really good fun. Get there early to secure a good seat. _x000D_
_x000D_
Then onto the elephant show at 11.30am. Once again, we arrived early and had a seat towards the front. The show was really entertaining. _x000D_
_x000D_
We then went alround seeing most of the animals: gibbons, hippos, white tiger, lions, giraffe, zebra etc. All good fun. I like the fact that animals aren't caged up but are given as much freedom as possible to roam around. _x000D_
_x000D_
There are numerous toilets and water points throughout the zoo. We had lunch at KFC in the kid zone (where there is a water 'park' that looked like great fun for the kids). Note it's cash only. There is a ""tram"" which only stops at the four designated stops around the zoo - so not that great for getting around as you'd miss a lot out. Much better to take it easy and walk around. We entered the park at 8.30am and left at 2.30pm after seeing most of what we wanted to see. _x000D_
_x000D_
We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the zoo. The best we've ever been to and a well deserved 5*. Highly recommended.

The ride is expensive though (costs about 33 Singapore dollar per person) and the first 25% of the ride does not really have any interesting views except for the view of the ocean, part of the Singapore grand prix track and Gardens by the bay. It is only once Gardens by the Bay comes, that all the sights including, the Marina Bay, the Singapore Skyline, Merlion Park, Esplanade, Helix Bridge, Marina Bay etc. are viewed with a mind boggling views. Get yourself clicked as many times with these different views in the background._x000D_

The one complaint I had though was the entire approach to actually finding the flyer is not very well designed and there should be many signboards. Also, the gift shops needs to have small models of the flyer to take back home and the staff in the gift shop could be a little more courteous._x000D_
_x000D_

We bought tickets to the amazon river cruise which upon arrival at the start of the ride (a one minute walk from the ticket counter) we were informed it would not go ahead due to the incoming storm. It seems pretty clear when selling the tickets a storm was imminent! We were then told we could not get a refund on the boat ride but could get a credit for the gift store. Upon complaining we were allowed to use it towards food. The river safari was largely fish in tanks with a few varieties of alligator and Turtles thrown in. The manatees were enjoyable._x000D_
We were booked on the 7.15pm Night Safari which also included a live show. We went through the gate at 7pm and were told the 7.15pm live show was now full but we could see the 8.15pm after our safari - all good. We then got ushered into an enormous queue which we stood in for 45min with our kids and elderly parents. We finally got into the tour at 7.45pm. The tour was 30min long and underwhelming.

The shophouses of Singapore (many of the remaining ones have have been remade into upscale bars and restaurants) housed businesses on the street level, the family living above, and newcomers crowded into awfully basic quarters above that.

The Singapore Zoo was well kept, neat and signages strategically placed to direct visitors to the various sectors of the zoo._x000D_

There are animals of Australasia, Africa, Borneo and many other countries. You can even find a polar bear in this tropical zoo. It was a good learning experience for the young as many have not seen so many animals from different countries. For the more senior visitors, they remarked their last visit was more than 15 years ago._x000D_
_x000D_
After walking for about 2 hours, we assembled at Ah Meng Terrace to rest our tired feet and have our lunch which was catered from the restaurant there. The food was good and well balanced. The restaurant management cordoned off a section of the covered terrace for our ""private function""._x000D_

After the lunch, most of us left the Singapore Zoo in our charted coaches. A number of our members stayed on to watch the animal shows in the afternoon. It takes about 4 hours to cover the whole zoo. There is a tram service (free for senior citizens) that brings you around the zoo._x000D_

484876753,2017-05-17 00:00:00.000,5,Fantastic but dedicate a whole day to it,"My partner and I visited the Jurong bird park during a recent visit to Singapore. Established in 1971 this is the worlds largest bird park containing various bird species from all corners of the world. As a bird fancier I couldn't miss it. Had a great time but underestimated the size of the park and the time it would take to go through it. Here are a few tips for those planning a visit here._x000D_
_x000D_
1. Getting here - The Jurong Bird Park is located in the Suburb of Jurong, which is located in the west of Singapore - far away from the tourist epicentre. We went via the MRT. You get on the green east-west line to 'Boon Lay'. This will eject you in a large shopping centre. Walk through this to the bus terminal and get on bus number 194. This runs in a loop and from the station it will be your first stop. Do the same backwards (if you miss catching the bus at the stop you were dropped off at you can walk under the highway to the opposite side of the road). Unfortunately getting here via the MRT takes quite some time - we spent around 1.5 hours each way from our hotel room on orchard road before we got into the park._x000D_
_x000D_
2. Cost - To purchase a ticket for Jurong it is 29 (adult), 19 (child) and 13 for a senior citizen. For what you get this is good value_x000D_
_x000D_
3. Food - There is two restaurants at the entrance to the park but both are quite overpriced as you would expect._x000D_
_x000D_
4. Weather dependent - The bird park is almost exclusively located outside which can be a problem with singapores often passing rainshowers._x000D_
_x000D_
5. Shows - There are a few shows but one that i would absolutely recommend is the 'King of the Skies' show which displays birds of prey such as vultures, flacons, eagles and hawks._x000D_
_x000D_
6. Time - This is where I really got it wrong. You really want around 4-5 hours in the park to cover everything. You will be surprised just how much stuff there is to do. When combined with significant travel times on the MRT you want to dedicate a whole day of your holiday to this bird park rather than thinking you can fit it into a half day slot._x000D_
_x000D_

A Tour of the Battlebox, the command centre for Singapore, was about to commence so we joined in. We were not disappointed and found the tour very informative and learnt many important points about the surrender of Singapore on 15 February 1942. The tour guide, Kamaliah, was very professional and knowledgeable and she explained that a new company had taken over the renovation and upkeep of the Battlebox in 2016._x000D_
We took the 'Story of Strategy and Surrender' tour and had the circumstances behind the Japanese invasion and subsequent surrender of Singapore by the British explained to us. There were many details that we were not aware of including the valiant defence of the vital NW coast of Singapore by the Australian 8th Division against the far superior Japanese forces led by the infamous General Yamashita._x000D_

551131130,2018-01-03 00:00:00.000,5,A great place to spend a day,"The public transport in Singapore is so efficient, we bought a three day Tourist pass and that enable us to take unlimited rides on MRT and buses. To get to the Zoo, we hopped on an MRT to Chao Chu Kang MRT station (1.5 hours from Orchard Road) and bus #927 (15min) that drops you directly at the front gates._x000D_
_x000D_
We bought our pass online via the Singapore Zoo website (S$55 per adult for 2 parks with5% discount if purchased online) and didnâ€™t have to queue at the long line at the Zoo. We did the Zoo and the River Safari on the one day, in my opinion, two parks is plenty for one day, unless you only spend a few seconds at each exhibit. There are so much to see and the sea lions (splash) show is a must. We also made the elephant show which was amazing to see these gentle giants work with their mahouts effortlessly. There are various feeding times for different animals, so it is good to plan your visit so you make the most of what you want to see. There is a tram (additional S$5 per adult) that takes you around the Zoo it is an easy way to get from one section to another. There is plenty of shade around the Zoo so although it could get quite hot and humid, the surroundings tree canopies offer good shelter while walking around. We had lunch at the Ah Meng restaurant that offered hawker type stalls with a variety of local food. The River Safari is only couple of minutes walk away from the Zoo, be sure to purchase the River Safari boat ride as some of the animals are only viewable from the boat ride S$5 per adult) you are able to go on the ride again as we missed some animals on one side. The queue could get quite long, but it is well worth the wait. There is another reservoir boat cruise that is included in the River Safari ticket but you donâ€™t to see any animals except the giraffes or the rhinos, if you are lucky.

It also has such a magnificent, well cared for, unbelievebly complex planting it is totally mind blowing. The man hours it must take to maintain this must be vast. Somehow everything works as does the clear harmony between plants and buildings seen throughout Singapore. Perhaps a model for many other Cities.

There was a range of colouring pages to choose from. Crayons and wet tissue were supplied. Both children and adults were delighted when they scanned in their colouring pages and saw their 2D creations become 3D ones in large interactive screens.

Still, nothing can beat the real stars of the park! Strongly suggest getting your tickets with the unlimited tramp rides! Really helps to hop on that when walking gets tiring. Many feeding sessions, everything is in the map. Also suggest planning your trip cause there's too much to see & never enough time! A token of S$5 for feeding. Bring some snacks for yourselves (snacks at the store outside zoo entrance is too pricey), there are about 4 shows, 1)rainforest fights back 2)elephants at work & play 3) animal friends 4) splash safari._x000D_

Elephant show was my personal favourite & also includes feeding them aft the show (pay S$5 for a small basket of fruits). Get there abt 40mins before the show if you want the best seats!_x000D_

This greenhouse skywalk is not for you. I opted to buy the $3 return tram ride from the entrance of the park to the greenhouse and given the stifling heat of the day I was happy I did.

414779873,2016-09-05 00:00:00.000,4,Different and worth a visit,"The night Safari is a different experience to the ordinary zoo trip and well worth a trip. We booked for the 8.15pm entry and had to stand in a queue to be let in. Alongside the queue was the fire eaters show and they didn't let us in until that had ended. Being small I couldn't see anything of the show but thought I'd be able to go to the next one. If there was one then it wasn't advertised which it seems a bit unfair for everyone on the 8.15,9.15 and 10.15 shows as we'd all paid the same. One of the reasons we chose the 8.15 was that it had far more tickets available than the 7.15 making it less busy and I also hoped to avoid lots of young children, in particular I was trying to avoid pushchairs. This worked to some extent but you still still get some people bringing out very young children late at night. The night show is worth attending as the keepers bring out animals to show you and explain about them. They ask that you don't use the flash on your camera. He explained that it damages the animals eyes as well as scaring them. He repeated this in at least 5 languages but there were still ignorant people using a flash!. If you go to the show first then there isn't such a large queue for the trams as everyone races to these when they open the doors. The tram ride is excellent with great views and good informative commentary. We saw tigers moving about whereas in the daytime they always just lie still. The baby elephant was especially adorable. At the end of the tram ride you can walk up some of the trails to see additional animals. I recommend you see the leopard which was patrolling his large enclosure and we got great views. Although they say you can hop on and off the tram in reality you can only do this at a couple of stops and even at night it's still hot so plan your route. I suggest you use your insect repellent but the biting insects were no where near as bad as I expected. The ice cream sold at the entrance/exit is excellent but pricey! Price wise I think the entrance fee is a bit expensive but hopefully this goes towards the care of the animals so I don't mind. Our only negative experience was the taxi back which wasn't the zoo's fault. The taxi we got in didn't have a working middle seat belt in the back and the driver didn't want to stop and let us get out to get another taxi. Eventually he turned round when we insisted for the 3rd or 4th time and said it wasn't safe. He then tried to charge us even though we'd told him before he set off that the belt didn't work. He knew there was no socket to clip it into but just kept driving. When we did get out he shouted abuse at us as he drove off as he was then at the back of the queue. So if 3 of you need to be in the back check the seat belts before you close the car doors!

Inside the Forest Clouds stand to what they claimed to be the highest indoor waterfalls. they made a sort of a mountain covered with lush vegetation. They provided a walkway all the way up and it's delightful to see the view below._x000D_
Both conservatories are air conditioned so bring a light jacket with you especially when you're near the waterfalls._x000D_

At night the Supertree Groves are lighted and they are amazing. They change colors every now and then. You can also pay $8 to walk up the supertrees._x000D_

And easy to reach via public transportation.,"We had visited maybe 15+ years ago and again last week- it's more incredible than ever. The grounds are Gorgeous, and our feathered friends really shine here- stunning photo opportunities. We chose to ride the tram (its $5 Singapore/ (about $3,70U.S.) and a great overview to see the sheer vastness of this place and to give you an idea of how to pace your stay and proximity to the 2 shows- both of which are not to be missed. They had not had the waterpark for kids before so unfortunately we did not have swimwear for our grandson with us but its a huge area and looked amazing (included). Our 6 yr old was dying to go again while we were in Singapore, he loved feeding the lories and every bit of his time here._x000D_
Very easy to do on your own, its about 30 min out of town- its a huge area, and easy to take the East West MRT (green line) to the Boon Lay station (EW27). I believe you can actually exit into the bus interchange but we did not spot the sign and came out at street level right on the corner. The Bus #194 is right across the street in the back of the mall. Just go IN the mall (not around it)- tons of buses depart from here and there are permanent lines for each- and signs to let you know when the next one is departing. Since the bus originated here we only waited maybe 6 min and everyone got a seat._x000D_
When we went the 1st time the bus stopped right in the parking lot so we were not watching as diligently as we should have, it stops on the street now about a half block before the entrance. Fortunately the Singaporean people are beyond kind and we obviously looked like tourists- camera and go pro were probably a good hint :0). They asked if we were headed for Jurong and the driver paused long enough for us to bolt off, but it was maybe 15 min bus ride. For the return, this was a one way street, if you walk through the covered arch to the street heading in the other direction- you will see the bus stop for the return- could not have been easier. We had the day to spend as much time as we wanted. Definitely one of our favorite things to do in Singapore- we were a family from age 6 to 77.

We booked our tour time (as we were, & do recommend). We filled in time at the River Safari until the gates opened & then went & had dinner at the night safari (as all food outlets at the River Safari had closed by the time we finished) while we waited for our allocated time slot. What we didn't realise was - we could have been doing our walking tour during this time.

520095788,2017-09-01 00:00:00.000,5,Excellent place for kids!,"I brought my 2 girls aged 6 and 8 during teacher day. We stayed there almost the entire day ( reach there before 11 and went off about 6 plus). They had truely enjoyed themselves there._x000D_
_x000D_
I bought the accesses for all 3 exhibits - future world, serpentiform and human +. On the himdsight, for them, I should have just bought the future world only. I dont think it is a place for adults especially if you go without any kids. Future world will be more for kids. adults can however explore other exhibits instead._x000D_
_x000D_
As this is kind of the first time we visited such place, they were truely amazed. We did not go to MOSH! before hence they went there without expectation. when they first inside, they thought there are just relaxing with the waves. But they gotten excited when the saw the slides and the interactive town._x000D_
_x000D_
That was not all! They saw people colouring and wanted to colour instead. and the surprize came after they scannes their pictures and send them to the floor. they were a bit difficult to find them though._x000D_
_x000D_
The highlight is the sketch town which they colour and scan them. They could find their truck and car on screen. They had great fun hunting and moving with their car. The other highlight for them is the scanning into 3D craft. They spent sometime doing the craft there but really enjoyed themselves and they wanted to do more. The disappointing part is that the 3d craft is only for the sketch town picture but not under water world and nature theme. But sketch town has quite a lot of pictures to draw and scan already!_x000D_
_x000D_
For the colourful big balls, safety aspects can probably be improved. My girls were complaining about people knocking them etc but I will take it that they will need to take care of themselves more and be careful when playing._x000D_
_x000D_
The hopscotch was intially not a fan for them but after another round.. they were excited to created it. But so much in jumping but to have their names appeared on the wall._x000D_
_x000D_
Space was another area which they liked. But there was only 1 terminal and my hp batt was running low. there were other people/ adults hogging on the terminal which did not give them the chance to create their universe._x000D_
_x000D_
Human + was disappointing (except for talking to the robot) but they did have so fun in the serperntiform when they were haunting for the snake with ipad and creating a snake for them to control or dance._x000D_
_x000D_
Overall great place for kids and if going with kids, just go for future world will do. The 'fun' in other exhibits did not justify the cost._x000D_

However, this most recent trip was wonderful. yes, this is a bit old now but they have a lot of different activities. top of the list for my daughter was the butterfly experience where she spent a full hour. butterfly places can be boring because, frankly, butterflies are there or they aren't - but in our case, there were enough to make it interesting in a circular exhibit area, available with magnifying glasses for up close viewing. After that, we toured the 'centre' which had a lot of new exhibits, most notably one based on ' fear' which was a lot of fun and indeed educational. inside, you can trace the history of what scared people, but in fun ways, and enjoy more than a few interactive exhibits. Then there is a floor on medical science, the fire demonstration, etc., etc. That said, there were at least several interesting areas which were not working or just a bit neglected - for example, a kids workshop which seemed to have all kinds of things to do but so many broken and no one staffing it. Anyway, the kids seemed to have a good time and the staff were quite helpful and friendly. Definitely worth a trip at least once a year. Of course, there are other attractions at the same location, including the Imax theatre (gets good reviews) and the snow place (which doesn't). Oh, we did go to the Kidstop placeplace which was expensive but lots of good fun. So, more than easy to fill an entire day here.",2018-08-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-30 10:32:35.087,AsiaMorgan,Singapore,Science Centre Singapore,Leisure & Recreation,"15 Science Centre Road Singapore Science Centre, Singapore 609081, Singapore",first time return science centre singapore eight year old daughter several year reluctant since remember age not appeal thought would daughter however recent trip wonderful yes bit old lot different activity top list daughter butterfly experience spent full hour butterfly place boring frankly butterfly not case enough make interest circular exhibit area available magnify glass close view tour centre lot new exhibit notably one base fear lot fun indeed educational inside trace history scar people fun way enjoy interactive exhibit floor medical science fire demonstration etc etc say least several interest area not work bit neglect example kid workshop seem kind thing many broken one staff anyway kid seem good time staff quite helpful friendly definitely worth trip least year course attraction location include imax theatre get good review snow place not oh go kidstop placeplace expensive lot good fun easy fill entire day

The cloud forest is not only breathtakingly beautiful but a great lesson in ecosystems and is all self sustaining. The tree top walk is not for vertigo sufferers but worthwhile as there is a good vantage point at the top of the 35 metre waterfall good for photos. Plenty of colourful rare flowers for keen photographers. Plus it's really cool and given the heat exhaustion from walking there it was a relief to have water mist on the face and a chance eto cool down. Although busy it was still easy to see all the lovely flowers and wooden carvings. In the flower dome the central orchid display was gorgeous and again animal wooden carvings made great interest points against the floral backdrop. We paid $28 per adult. Our 5yr old also enjoyed it even though it was a long walk there and he's not a great walker! Still there's a $3 shuttle bus you can take to the front of the conservatories plus there is a lift which takes you most of the way to the top of the waterfall in the cloudy forest then u bend you're way down round the montane side.,2016-08-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-25 15:59:11.934,SREnglish,United Kingdom,Gardens by the Bay,Leisure & Recreation,"18 Marina Gardens Drive | Bayfront Plaza, Singapore 018953, Singapore",not sure whether conservatory glad cloud forest not breathtakingly beautiful great lesson ecosystem self sustain tree top walk not vertigo sufferer worthwhile good vantage point top metre waterfall good photo plenty colourful rare flower keen photographer plus really cool give heat exhaustion walk relief water mist face chance eto cool although busy still easy see lovely flower wooden carving flower dome central orchid display gorgeous animal wooden carving make great interest point floral backdrop paid per adult yr old also enjoy even though long walk not great walker still shuttle bus take front conservatory plus lift take way top waterfall cloudy forest u bend way round montane side

541885739,2017-11-19 00:00:00.000,3,Great View of the City...but Spendy,"I'm a world traveler who loves theme parks, rides, and silly touristy activities. I have now ridden 9 of the 10 tallest observation wheels in the world, so riding the Singapore Flyer with my fiancee last month when we were in Singapore was a no-brainer!_x000D_
_x000D_
When you ride so many of these observation wheels around the world, you begin to notice that the experience is virtually identical each time. The only thing that truly differs is the view...and the Singapore Flyer doesn't disappoint in the view it offers! At 541 feet tall, it is (as of November, 2017) the second tallest observation wheel in the world, dwarfed only by 9 feet between it and the World's Tallest Wheel, the High Roller in Las Vegas._x000D_
_x000D_
First off, if you're afraid of heights, don't be afraid to ride the Flyer. I have a strong fear of heights (which is funny, because I love riding roller coasters and other tall rides!), yet I experienced no fear during my trip around the Flyer. In our car was another woman who was DEATHLY afraid of heights and she ended up enjoying her ride as well. It takes approximately 30 minutes to complete a full rotation, but the wheel moves so slowly that you can barely feel it moving. The cabins (or capsules as they are sometimes called on other wheels) are large, spacious, secure, and offer ample views in all directions, as well as up and down. A ride at sunset offers spectacular views of the waning sunlight as the city powers up its nighttime lighting for a lovely view that is completely different at the end of the ride as it is the beginning. Each cabin is air-conditioned to provide a respite from the sweltering Singapore heat and humidity._x000D_

Once you have completed your voyage, you--as always--exit through the gift shop. In the gift shop, you can view the picture they took of you before your flight (in front of a green screen) nicely composited in front of a wide variety of backgrounds. You can buy different packages of these photos. Additionally, there are t-shirts, key chains, refrigerator magnets, shot glasses, and other souvenirs offered for not only the Singapore Flyer, but also the country and city of Singapore._x000D_
_x000D_
If you're a tourist visiting Singapore, go do the Flyer if you've never ridden it before. Yeah, it's pricey and a little out of the way, but cabs are reasonable and public transportation is cheap and efficient. If you're staying at the Marina Bay Sands, the Singapore Flyer is within walking distance across the river._x000D_

This part of the city never sleeps and will provide you all kind of entertainment like best of the foods ( you may find the joints expensive, but anyway Singapore is expensive)..

391915951,2016-07-13 00:00:00.000,3,The only good thing is you see the animals up REAL close,"The safari is open for only a few hours as staff and visitors need to sleep obviously, so it closes at midnight. However it also becomes too dark to see anything properly, making the things you can do here really limited. And you cant come too early like 7-6pm cos the animals might not have waken up yet._x000D_
_x000D_
Because of the darkness, its really hard to wander on your own in the park - they're really thoughtful to create the animals' real natural environment so streetlights were a bare minimum. The dense vegetation also makes it hard to figure your way around :( I strongly recommend taking the tram which goes one round around the entire park. That ride is pretty much the highlight of the entire visit, but guessing it was a 40min ride it wasn't too bad. There are trails u could walk, but I think the tram would cover more ground, and u need time to walk the trail, each is abt 20-30min, so plan your time here._x000D_
_x000D_
As the name suggests there were NO enclosures at all, animals literally walked across the tram path freely and as the path was quite narrow, you could get quite close with the animals if they grazed near the sides. Larger and more dangerous animals are probably separated by a ditch or something i think. The closeness u get w so many animals is something I never had before so this was pretty memorable for me._x000D_

An hour or so later the sky finally turned blue and the sun came out so I asked the counter when the sky bridge would reopen, a lady very rudely grabbed her phone pointed to it and said according to my phone it's going to rain at 1pm so it won't open. I didn't appreciate her attitude and it didn't even end up raining so that was a shame. We bought tickets online for the flower dome and cloud Forrest. It's worth buying beforehand to avoid queues. The flower dome was full of so many amazing trees, bushes and plants and it smelt so beautiful. The cloud Forrest was my favourite because it was so green and the waterfall was so mystical.

I was served by Paul who sold me a brand called 'Pro' (NP-FW50 and LP-ESN). Pro NP-FW50 is purported to have 5000mAh and Pro LP-E6N 6000mAh and both batteries are said to be made in Japan. I stupidly took what Paul said on face value and having paid for the batteries, I investigated them on the internet and sought advice from another very large camera store. The batteries 'Pro' are not on the internet and are in fact a rubbish replica of 'Pro Master' from China. The cover on the actual battery is a very close replica of Pro Master batteries, but a deception. I returned to the store and requested a refund. Paul refused a refund but said he would exchange them. For what? He would only exchange for the exact batteries I wanted to return! Beware of this shop. Do your homework before you agree to buy anything, especially when given 'a good deal if you buy today'. If Paul was aware the product was a cheap replica, he deceived me, gave false information and should have refunded my money. If by chance he didn't know it was a cheap replica, he has inadvertently sold me a false product and should return my money and then take it up with the supplier. I would certainly not return to this store and I would advise anyone entering this shop to beware.",2019-01-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-30 11:59:54.097,lyndallc2014,Australia,Chinatown,Precinct & Street,"Crot | Trengganu, Singapore 048942, Singapore",visit dg electronics pagoda st singapore bought camera battery one canon another sony camera serve paul sell brand call pro np fw lp esn pro np fw purport mah pro lp en mah battery say make japan stupidly take paul say face value paid battery investigate internet sought advice another large camera store battery pro not internet fact rubbish replica pro master china cover actual battery close replica pro master battery deception return store request refund paul refuse refund say would exchange would exchange exact battery want return beware shop homework agree buy anything especially give good deal buy today paul aware product cheap replica deceive give false information refund money chance not know cheap replica inadvertently sell false product return money take supplier would certainly not return store would advise anyone enter shop beware

At checkin had to wait a while for check in queue as it was quite busy as youvwould expected. We were confused as there were no sign to where checking was. Had to ask someone for help._x000D_
Wasnt happy with one staff as they asked if we wanted to pay more as we requested rooms close by. We have 3 kids and didnt want to be in rooms too far apart._x000D_
We were told we will recieve email once rooms are ready. Waited and nothing so had to go checkin desk again to ask._x000D_
Served by another staff who was very nice and efficient and professional. Told us she found us rooms available next to each other. Really appreciated her effort as it made a big diff when your travelling with small kids._x000D_
Rooms were nice clean modern and felt luxurious. Large nice showers/ bathroom. We stayed in deluxe room on the 20th floor. Spectacular views of the gardens by the bay. Was special waking up and opening your curtains to that. I think the gardens view is way nicer than city view and saves you a bit :) Each room had a nice large balcony. No outdoor furniture though, not even a wicker chair to sit and enjoy the view which is puzzling._x000D_
Lots of shops mostly high end brands. Restaurants cafes pharmacy small supermarket....prices generally exp. Affordable food court goid for kids on lower floor._x000D_

It looks nice from any angle, day or night. In the day, the sheer amount of green makes viewing the gardens pleasant to the eyes, and at night, the lights emitted by the supertrees makes the gardens look like a lively one that never sleeps. The conservatories were cooling and I learnt a lot from the conservatories, such as the many different species of flowers in the flower dome and the geography behind the water cycle in the cloud forests. A wide range of flora and eye-catching flowers with vivid colors. For those who a hungry a meal at Satay by the Bay is recommended, and although their prices can be slightly higher than the regular hawker centre/food court in Singapore, it is definitely cheaper than most of the restaurants in the city area.

The sea lion exhibit/show at 10.30 am was quite entertaining and not full so we were able to have great seats -don't sit in the first two rows if you want to stay dry._x000D_

_x000D_
It was a really hot day, 33 degrees or so, and we found walking round very tiring but there is a cool zone in each area which was an extremely pleasant stopping point to cool down before continuing._x000D_
_x000D_
Make sure you check elephant feeding time early on, fortunately we stumbled across one as it was happening and saw them perform tricks that didnâ€™t appear cruel on the animals. Lovely to watch them. Recommend actually standing to one side as opposed to sitting with the crowds as we had a much better and nearer view stood side on._x000D_
_x000D_
There is no need to buy water there, as there are loads of water refill stations which are free, as the park promotes this, so just take a bottle. If you have to buy water, a carton cost us $2SGD. Slush ice drinks are more expensive at $7SGD._x000D_

The white tiger was my highlight. He was quite active and was lovely to see him moving about._x000D_
_x000D_
So many amazing animals._x000D_

There was a splash zone for the kids to cool off. This is at no additional cost, so be sure to take their swim stuff along. Changing facilities were good. Lots of regular toilet stops too around the park which were clean and was lovely having the sink areas outside overlooking ponds!_x000D_

Thoroughly recommend visiting here - allow a full day. Donâ€™t be tempted to split a day with the River Safari next door, as youâ€™ll miss stuff. The River Safari next door is probably a 4/5 hour trip at most._x000D_
_x000D_
Getting there was dead easy. We recommend using the MRT (canâ€™t recall stop) and then 138 bus (think thatâ€™s right). It goes from bus station directly opposite MRT and zoo is last stop so canâ€™t be missed either way._x000D_

336786464,2016-01-03 00:00:00.000,4,Wonderful garden inside & outside the domes.,"We love visiting gardens all around the world and do so in every country that we visit. The Gardens by the Bay is an expansive garden that would take a whole day to enjoy on foot and it's worth it to get the all day tram pass for just a few dollars. It's very pram and wheelchair friendly and accessible. Most areas are free to access but there are tickets for purchase for the domes and the skywalk (for which you need to book a time slot). Food is also available from the food court style places or restaurants._x000D_
_x000D_
The 2 glass domes/conservatories were well kept and cool with beautiful plants and trees curated within. A good time to visit the cloud dome is when they are misting as it creates an ethereal jungle feel. Words can't really describe the variety and beauty of the plants kept there. We were there in Dec 15, so we got to see the Christmas decorations and flowers that were displayed in the flower dome as well. The city skyline seen through the glass is also beautiful._x000D_

Take note of the super trees light show times as well. I think folks of all ages will love this place._x000D_

663356285,2019-04-03 00:00:00.000,5,Tips to enjoy this Cloud Forest,"We've been here at least five times, and we loved it each time. It contains the tallest man-made indoor waterfall when it was built, that waterfall still stands at about 7-stories high, and what's awesome is that you get to walk INTO and AROUND this waterfall via the sky bridges which kind of wraps around the central waterfall tower. It's a pretty normal building within the waterfall, but if you're into stalactites and stalagmites and similar nature's beautiful formations in caves, you'll find a giant collection in there too. What I personally enjoyed most was the secret garden right down at the bottom, it gets all misty and mysterious especially at night. And of course the climate change video --- great environmental lesson for all._x000D_
_x000D_
Since we've been here at different times of the year and day, we noticed a pattern and probably some tips to better this place better:_x000D_
_x000D_
1. Day to come:_x000D_
During certain weekends and the obvious public holidays, it gets so crowded that you have to queue just to get ONTO the elevator, which is essential since the tour kinda starts top down. Average of a 15-minute queue. If possible, avoid these days._x000D_
_x000D_
2. Time to come:_x000D_
Another way to avoid the crowds is to come in the evenings. They close at 8.30pm so if you can come at 7pm or later, when most other tourists are out having dinner, you'll almost have a whole fantastic cloud forest to your own AND enjoy the misty, chilly conditions, kind of like in a real dense forest. The musical lights show at Supertree Grove is at 7.45pm or 8.45pm, so you could probably plan you itinerary to match those._x000D_
_x000D_
3. Other tips_x000D_
The elevators only bring you to the 6th floor, and you gotta change to another elevator that brings you to the extreme top. This other elevator makes this place pram/stroller/wheelchair friendly. Also, the ""secret garden"" at the bottom seems a little harder to access to. Make sure you don't miss it after the climate change screening. Look out for the signage that points you there.",2019-01-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-29 11:32:52.598,maryyeo,Vietnam,Cloud Forest,Leisure & Recreation,"18 Marina Gardens Drive | 18 Marina Gardens Drive, Singapore 018953, Singapore",weve least five time love time contains tallest man make indoor waterfall built waterfall still stand story high awesome get walk around waterfall via sky bridge kind wrap around central waterfall tower pretty normal building within waterfall stalactite stalagmite similar nature beautiful formation cave find giant collection personally enjoy secret garden right bottom get misty mysterious especially night course climate change video great environmental lesson allxd xd since different time year day notice pattern probably tip well place betterxd xd day comexd certain weekend obvious public holiday get crowd queue get onto elevator essential since tour kinda start top average minute queue possible avoid daysxd xd time comexd another way avoid crowd come evening close pm come pm later tourist dinner almost whole fantastic cloud forest enjoy misty chilly condition kind like real dense forest musical light show supertree grove pm pm could probably plan itinerary match thosexd xd tipsxd elevator bring th floor get ta change another elevator brings extreme top elevator make place pramstrollerwheelchair friendly also secret garden bottom seem little harder access make sure not miss climate change screen look signage point

Naturally I would enter via the entrance situated nearest to the mrt but I was denied entry in the basis that my ticket needed to be redeemable only at a booth situated at the flower dome (which was a 15 Min walk) before I was able to enter Christmas wonderland. I had young children and elderly in tow and the walk was impossible, essentially I had no choice but to pay for the shuttle. I asked for some flexibility to enter Christmas wonderland and walk through it to the flower dome as I was already at the Christmas wonderland entrance but was told thatâ€™s I couldnâ€™t because GBTB had no control over it as they partnered with presumably some other operator for Christmas wonderland. I donâ€™t understand why there is only one booth for redemption of tickets inconveniently located at flower dome. They should have made it more user friendly - surely it would have made sense to have a booth located near the mrt. It does not matter to the consumer whether the both was run by GBTB or another operator, the organisers should work together to create a seamless experience for visitors. Worse still, it was Christmas Eve and yet the shuttle ended at 9pm. I had to take the long walk back to the mrt which was difficult for young children and elderly.

We went to the flower dome first and we were just so disappointed. It was rammed with tourists, selfie sticks and pushy people trying to get that perfect Instagram photo. Despite the many signs saying not to to touch the flowers and plants, so many were broken and dead from people sitting on ledges where they trail and grabbing roses for pictures. I just didn't get the attraction.. the dome is impressive and many of the plants are really beautiful, however the organisation and displays were nothing out of this world. We wandered for 20 mins or so then just had to leave._x000D_
We had high hopes for cloud forest and were hoping for the trip to be salvaged! Not the case unfortunately. The queue for the dome stretched for what seemed like miles. After about a 20 minute wait we were in, and then told it was a minimum 1 hour wait to go to the top! (I should mention we went at 6pm which is perhaps peak time so that people can can catch the light show, even still, it was really terrible crowd control.) We got in, the 'mountain' is cool to look at I guess, although I couldn't get past it being a man made structure and not really sure what I was supposed to be marvelling at. Again the queuing and noise and selfies just ruined whatever nice experience we could have had._x000D_
We didn't bother waiting the hour to get to the top, not sure what is up there but if it's just views of the city I'm sure there is better vantage points from elsewhere._x000D_
All in all, we didn't enjoy the experience and can't really understand the hype. $28 each is WAY too much._x000D_

377853428,2016-05-30 00:00:00.000,4,Lovely experience,"One of the things we enjoyed in Singapore was the River Safari._x000D_
It was originally meant to have a River cruise, the Amazon River Quest meandering along the perimeter of the River safari and it would have been wonderful in that climate, but the rains put a stop to it as the cruise was suspended the day to avert any calamities. The River safari is built along the river theme along major rivers of the world â€“ The Congo, the Nile, the Mekong, Ganges, Mississippi, Mary and Yangtze. The sea animals that inhabit these rivers form a part of the exhibits in each of these zones._x000D_
_x000D_
The Congo River exhibit named after the deepest river Congo contains colourful fishes like Congo tetras, cichlids, puffer fish, the salamander, and few other fishes._x000D_
The Nile, the longest river has the African arowana, the tigerfish, and the catfish, while Mississipi (The largest river system in North America, that flows through 10 states and is the worldâ€™s fourth longest river) contains the alligator gar, the paddlefish and the snapping turtle._x000D_
The Ganges zone has 2 large gharials that are so huge and stationery that they look like stone statues. The Mekong river has the giant catfish, sting rays and the macaque and you can then walk into a massive underwater aquarium in the Flooded Forest zone with huge fishes swimming around you. There are seating arrangements for you to rest and just gaze at those large and predatory fishes swim around and it is peaceful to watch them a long time. Some of these are 3m long and weigh 300 kg. You can watch around 4-5 sea otters diving into the water and then onto the log like rafts to relax a while and then hop on to the land, run around there and then dive back in. They rarely stay still and spend all their time repeating this activity. There are magnificent manatees that swim around gracefully, doing twirls and spins in the water that you can watch for a while._x000D_
Once you have had your fill of the underwater experience, you can walk into the Giant Panda forest which houses the red panda and 2 cute giant pandas Kai Kai and Jia Jia in their own separate open areas. They are a darling of the crowds as they look fluffy and adorable, while all they do is plonk themselves and munch on bamboo shoots ignoring the adoring audience._x000D_
All this is close to an hour of walking and so the next stop is an eatery, Mama Panda Kitchen, where we can enjoy some coffee under the clouds and some cute panda cakes._x000D_
We then cross over a bridge across the river that looks green and serene, into the squirrel monkey forest, watch a huge anaconda, and stroll through a tropical aviary.",2015-11-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-30 03:54:07.532,LekhaSM,India,River Safari,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road Singapore Zoological Gardens, Singapore 729826, Singapore",one thing enjoy singapore river safarixd originally meant river cruise amazon river quest meander along perimeter river safari would wonderful climate rain put stop cruise suspend day avert calamity river safari built along river theme along major river world congo nile mekong ganges mississippi mary yangtze sea animal inhabit river form part exhibit zonesxd xd congo river exhibit name deepest river congo contains colourful fish like congo tetra cichlid puffer fish salamander fishesxd nile long river african arowana tigerfish catfish mississipi large river system north america flow state worldatms fourth long river contains alligator gar paddlefish snap turtlexd ganges zone large gharials huge stationery look like stone statue mekong river giant catfish sting ray macaque walk massive underwater aquarium flood forest zone huge fish swim around seat arrangement rest gaze large predatory fish swim around peaceful watch long time long weigh kg watch around sea otter dive water onto log like raft relax hop land run around dive back rarely stay still spend time repeat activity magnificent manatee swim around gracefully twirl spin water watch whilexd fill underwater experience walk giant panda forest house red panda cute giant panda kai kai jia jia separate open area darling crowd look fluffy adorable plonk munch bamboo shoot ignore adore audiencexd close hour walk next stop eatery mama panda kitchen enjoy coffee cloud cute panda cakesxd cross bridge across river look green serene squirrel monkey forest watch huge anaconda stroll tropical aviary

Once we were in the night safari (it is a big open bus), we went into the zoo/safari with a predefined running commentary telling us what were the animals that we were looking at. It was almost 40-45 minute Safari in that open bus. Now, let me tell you the pros & cons:Pros:1. New experience which we don't get to see at many places2. Very well managed even after heavy crowd (we were there in last week of December)Cons:1. Too few animals & therefore I felt the safari is overpriced.2. They try to make money from the photographs & photos are just too expensive.3. Apart from 1 tiger, no other wild cats were seen.4. Most of the time, the visibility levels were very very low.5. If possible, they should merge Night Safari & River Safari and have combined tickets for them.",2018-12-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-30 14:45:13.012,AmitShidhaye,India,Night Safari,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",book night safari ticket online book convenient reach long queue get shorten quickly number vehicle therefore not take much time queue get night safari big open bus go zoosafari predefined run commentary tell u animal look almost minute safari open bus let tell pro conspros new experience not get see many place well manage even heavy crowd last week december con animal therefore felt safari overprice try make money photograph photo expensive apart tiger wild cat see time visibility level low possible merge night safari river safari combine ticket

_x000D_
We went on a weekday 9.15pm session. We arrived at 8ish so that we could wait in line. There are cute shops and heaps of places to eat as well as a fire show (you'll have to google times for this as i can't recall) so after we had a look around we stood in line at around 8.45pm. Even though it seemed like it was a huge line, the wait to get onto the actual safari bus wasn't too long so i suggest going for the latest session. We saw the line for the 8.15 session which was almost triple the size of the 9.15 one._x000D_
_x000D_
The safari itself is a good length, informative and fun. We got to see most the animals, but there were a few that were hiding or resting. Some animals are close enough to touch (but don't touch them!) which we thought was pretty cool._x000D_
_x000D_
Try and catch the Creatures of the night show. We actually weren't planning on going but we got back from the safari just as a show was starting and thought ""why not?"". We were super glad we went as its entertaining and the animals are adorable and the host was really funny!_x000D_

614358299,2018-09-06 00:00:00.000,5,Great Animal Interactions Especially the Feedings,"The Singapore Zoo was topmost on my son's to do list and the place didn't disappoint. It took us half a day to completely cover the zoo and we combined walking with hopping on and off the tram. There are a lot of animals to see from lions to elephants to bears to penguins._x000D_
You can plan your day as per the shows you want to see and the feedings you want to do. We saw the Splash Safari and the water seal put up a good show. The photo op with the orangutan family was also good fun._x000D_
Initially we had planned to leave by 1 but after checking the feeding times we extended it to 2 pm. And it was the best hour we spent in Singapore. At 1:15 pm we fed the rhinos. My son being only three wasn't allowed to feed the rhino but he could stand with me and get pictures taken while I fed the beautiful beast. A animal feeding session costs 5 SGD and you must carry exact change with you. I didn't have change and feared that my son would be disappointed when it was our turn. But the lady behind us in the line was kind enough to pay for us._x000D_
Immediately after this we moved to the giraffe zone which is right next to the rhinos for the 1:50 pm feeding session. We were first in line and super excited as our son would be allowed to feed the giraffes with his own hands. But when they opened the lines, the giraffe family of 3 was just not interested in eating and would come no way near the feeding area. The zoo staff was prompt to react - one member went inside the giraffe enclosure and slowly but surely lured the giraffes to the feeding staton. Those ten minutes we kept praying lest our son be disappointed. When he was finally able to feed carrots to Marco the giraffe, he was extremely happy - definitely the highlight of his holiday._x000D_
The zoo offers prams and strollers. We didn't use one as our son was happy to walk and explore. But for kids who are reluctant to walk, I would recommend using a stroller as there is a lot of walking to do, the weather can get hot and stuffy, and the tram stations are few and far between._x000D_

378090886,2016-05-31 00:00:00.000,5,great escape from the hustle and bustle. So easy to get to.,"I had a day to spare so decided to take a walk in nature rather than around the malls. Best day out. MacRichie Reservoir walk is really pretty, and most of it is either within the trees, or around the lake and you can't see or hear any part of the city._x000D_
It is easy to get to: I took the MRT to Coldecutt station, and then had a 250m walk to the entrance by the dam off Lornie Road._x000D_
I then started off in an anti-clockwise direction up towards the ranger station. After a few hundred metres around the lake edge the Nature Trail headed into the trees and the next few kms were all in shade._x000D_
At the top of the park is the ranger station which offers toilets and drinking fountains. Note that other than at the bottom by the dam (where there is a food counter and vending machines) there is nowhere to buy food or water. So carry what you need._x000D_
The treetop walk is just a single span suspension bridge that gets above the tree canopy. Well constructed and solid. LOTS of stairs going up to and down from the walkway._x000D_
After completing the tree top walkway you have the choice of returning the way you came or carrying on around the lake. The second half of the walk is very pretty around the end of the lake and adjoining golf course, but much of it is exposed to the sun so make sure you bring a hat and sunscreen (and of course lots of water). Much of the complete 12km walk is on boardwalks (which are well constructed and maintained), but there are short sections of gravel path that would preclude disabled access._x000D_
All up about 12km in distance, which took about three hours. I went on a Sunday and it was busy but never obstrusive._x000D_
After returning to the Dam I took the bus to Bishan MRT.",2016-05-01 00:00:00.000,Solo,2020-01-30 09:44:17.311,Andrew_NZ120,New Zealand,MacRitchie Reservoir,Nature & Wildlife,"Off Lornie Road, Singapore, Singapore",day spare decide take walk nature rather around mall best day macrichie reservoir walk really pretty either within tree around lake can not see hear part cityxd easy get take mrt coldecutt station walk entrance dam lornie roadxd start anti clockwise direction towards ranger station hundred metre around lake edge nature trail head tree next km shadexd top park ranger station offer toilet drinking fountain note bottom dam food counter vend machine nowhere buy food water carry needxd treetop walk single span suspension bridge get tree canopy well construct solid lot stair go walkwayxd complete tree top walkway choice return way come carry around lake second half walk pretty around end lake adjoin golf course much expose sun make sure bring hat sunscreen course lot water much complete km walk boardwalk well construct maintain short section gravel path would preclude disabled accessxd km distance take three hour go sunday busy never obstrusivexd return dam take bus bishan mrt

Trade exploded, and other quays, Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay, for instance were developed. This humble river is where Sir Stamford Raffles first stepped on the island in 1819. In the 1970s when shipping trade was moved, the river underwent a transformation. There are many hotspots dotted along the river, you can cool down with a drink and enjoy mouth-watering cuisines at Boat Quay. Keen for more heart-pumping entertainment? Dance the night away at Clarke Quay at the trendy nightspots that once were warehouses. For a slice of nostalgia, stop by the moored Chinese junks ('tongkangs') that have been beautifully refurbished into floating restaurants. Youâ€™ll find laid-back charm at Robertson Quayâ€™s converted godowns, perfect for a morning coffee.

I find those reviews that gave poor or average reviews as queer because they feel its not worth it for different reasons. If you are an F1 enthusiast, or concerts, or just looking for a weekend that feels like a party each and every night, this place is for you. So to these critics, STOP complaining! To each to his own and this night race weekend provides that. There are other F1 races whose vantage points are superior to those in singapore f1. If so, go to those places as Sing F1 is obviously not for you. Mind you, this is a night race as other races are done during the day so if you want to stay under the sun, go to other races. A night race in my opinion provides a more pleasant experience._x000D_
_x000D_
For the complete package, an entrance fee allows the patron multiple choices of watching the race, several concerts, several booths of multitudes of activities. and if you like ferraris or porsches they also have their own race at late afternoons. By the way, this is the only F1 race that includes not just 1 concert, but at least 1 main concert every night for 3 nights. For this year's, we are talking of several. I was able to watch 4 out of the 6 either at Padang or at the Esplanade outdoor Theatre. The ultimate concert experience with Queen and Adam Lambert, and an exciting race with a close finish between Rosberg and Ricciardo. Yeah, you can watch it on TV. But its just the same as watching a live ppv boxing match: its different watching it on TV versus watching it live even if the protagonists are matchbox sizes. The noise of the formula 1 cars zooming, the rumble, the cheering of the different loyalists, you can't feel that on TV._x000D_

There are fixed timings to the tour, so you might want to check out their website to avoid disappointment. There's the 1-hour Battlebox tour and the 2.5 hours Battlebox and Fort Canning tour. My son is big on WWII stuff now so we brought him for his birthday and we had real fun. Our guide, Joanne, was friendly and informative and addressed the questions of his curious audience, which mostly consisted of Caucasian tourists. We took a short 3-minute walk to the start of the air-conditioned tunnels. It's definitely not a tour for screaming kids or those who might be inclined to claustrophobia. The tour was a mixture of presentation by Joanne and watching three videos. The best part of the tour was the parts of the tunnels which were from the time of the war (doors which were sliced to allow for more ventilation, Japanese writing etched on the wall, a generator of sorts). There are a lot of realistic wax sculptures and interesting production design to recreate the final days of WWII. Our guide told us about how they might be changing it to allow for a self-guided tour, though I kind of like the personal human-element of the tour. I craved more WWII artefacts to be on displayed within the tunnels. There's a nice store which sells interesting books at the end of the tour. I bought a thick book on The Fall of Singapore and two other books for my son, but I think I'm enjoying the books as much as he is.",2017-01-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-30 04:32:38.370,Michael W,Singapore,Battlebox,"Art, History & Culture","2 Cox Terrace | Fort Canning Park, Singapore 179622, Singapore",hard find thing singaporean parent satisfy insatiable curiosity year old happen stroll around fort can stumble upon poster battlebox fix timing tour might want check website avoid disappointment hour battlebox tour hour battlebox fort can tour son big wwii stuff brought birthday real fun guide joanne friendly informative address question curious audience mostly consist caucasian tourist take short minute walk start air condition tunnel definitely not tour scream kid might inclined claustrophobia tour mixture presentation joanne watch three video best part tour part tunnel time war door slice allow ventilation japanese write etch wall generator sort lot realistic wax sculpture interest production design recreate final day wwii guide told u might change allow self guide tour though kind like personal human element tour crave wwii artefact displayed within tunnel nice store sell interest book end tour bought thick book fall singapore two book son think enjoy book much

The main level had a small gift kiosk (which supports the Temple), prayer/altar area, and Buddha displays along the sides and beyond the altar. Beautiful reds and golds, resonating with the chanting of the Monks, was stunning. There is a lift that takes you up to a few middle floors housing artefacts that is certainly worth a look. The rooftop garden with a large prayer drum was so tranquil you would not know that you are in the centre of a large city.

Two gripes form me though that I hope the management will take note:_x000D_
1) I fell down at the kiddo area because the tiles were slippery. I was actually quite shocked that it could be that slippery in an obviously wet attraction. Of course it seemed that the management knew about it with all the rubber mats placed around the kiddo play area. Yet these rubber mats proved to be tripping hazards too when it folded up. I tried looking for staff assistance to pull it flat, but unfortunately, none were in sight._x000D_
_x000D_
2) Having towel rentals near the tsunami is a bit of an illogical consequence especially when patrons generally do not carry money with them. At $10 deposit per towel is also ridiculous. I could have made money selling bath towels at half the price at the entrance to the attraction!

447032329,2016-12-28 00:00:00.000,4,Possibly Best Hiking Trail in Singapore,"Singapore is predominantly an urban city. This is probably the closest thing to a hike that you can get in Singapore. Set aside a minimum of 2 hours for the hike itself. Add more time if you will be stopping anywhere._x000D_
_x000D_
Suggested things to bring: water, poncho or umbrella (in case of sudden rain), ziplock for your precious phone, and of course money (in case you need to buy food/drinks or give up and take train back!)._x000D_
_x000D_
As Singapore weather can get rather hot in the late morning, I would suggest starting at around 7 am. Start from the start point beside the motorbike parking lots, in between Seah Im Food Centre and Marang Road. It's on the east (not west) side of the food centre. You can have breakfast at the food centre before the hike, and wash up at the not-so-clean toilets before the hike. This start point is just next to HarbourFront MRT Station._x000D_
_x000D_
From there, you hike up a series of steps up Mount Faber to the cable car station. This is the Marang Trail. Then you proceed onto the Faber Trail, with panoramic vies of the Southern Part of Singapore. You end up at Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore at 36 metres above Henderson Road._x000D_
_x000D_
Crossing Henderson Waves, you end up in Hilltop Walk, then Forest Walk leading to Alexandra Arch. At this place, you have the option of proceeding westwards towards Flora Walk, HortPark, Canopy Walk and eventually Ken Ridge Park. Or you can turn southwards towards the Labrador Nature & Costal Walk. Normally, at Alexandra Arch, I turn back. Time taken for a normal walk is 1 hour to reach Alexandra Arch and another hour for the return trip. Total distance to Alexandra Arch and back is about 9 km._x000D_
_x000D_
If you are hungry on your return trip, you can get down from Henderson Waves, move northwards towards Telok Blangah Way and locate this place called SAFRA Mount Faber. You can try local coffee (kopi) and toast at Ya Kun. Or you can soldier on and return back to Seah Im Food Centre to try other local food including Indian Rojak._x000D_

For me it is the right mix of curated, non curated, selvage. Before I came by bus ( close to Tanglin Mall) and went home by subway MRT. In this way I was sure to be eco friendly and I did the whole park. But recently a friend of mine indicated to me the car park at Cluny Road ( Nassim Gate) close to the shops and Casa Verde. I will use Nassim Gate and the car park only during the week. Some of my friends practice Yoga in the park, some come for running ....I just love the flowers, the big space and being right in the middle of the city without paying anything!_x000D_

The cute cafe was inviting with the smell of the fresh coffee and pastries. I think it's a perfect place for date.

I LOVEd the museum and the love and RESPECT to life that you see in every detail, HOW people around care about that place.

I had once visited here when my children were young, holding their hands up the steep slope. I had also visited here with my childhood friends and remembered our sports shoes were dirtied with mud after an adventurous walking trail filled with mud. This time I am here with my team of grassroots leaders and it was our first time coming back after the nature reserve has renovated._x000D_
_x000D_
Our coach driver seem new to this place and drove us right near the car park of the visitor center and having a hard time maneuvering his way out thereafter. It would be advisable that passengers alight a distance from the car park and walk a short distance to the visitor center if you are coming by bus._x000D_
_x000D_
When we arrived at the visitor center and was taking our photo at the landmark rock at the visitor center, a CISCO guard came and advised me to register at the counter since we are a big group of 33. He explained to me that we should have notified NParks in advance if we are visiting the place as a group. I apologized for my ignorance and wrote down the name of my grassroots organization on the register. So, if you are bringing a full bus load of residents, please notify NParks in advance._x000D_
_x000D_
We decided to do some warm up exercises before proceeding up the hill. One of my members led the warm up exercises. She switched on her hand phone with some music playing to add in fun for the warm up exercises. This time, another CISCO guard approached us after we had finished with our warm-up exercises and told us that music playing is prohibited at the nature reserve. He did not explain the reason just told us it is a rule which we should not violate. Again, I had to apologize for my ignorance._x000D_
_x000D_
Despite these early hiccups, the journey up the hill was exhilarating and refreshing. I sweated profusely as my heart pounded at the most arduous steep slope up to the summit. But it was just a short slope up. It is nothing compared to the multiple long flight of stairs when you are scaling up the mountains in China be it Taishan, Ermeishan or even the Great Wall of China._x000D_
_x000D_
Up at the summit, we took some group photos and commenced our mission impossible: Anti-littering picking and First Aid refresher training. We are a group of First Aiders and we seized this opportunity of outing to revise and refresh our first aid training: refreshing our knowledge on the various bandages for the different types of injuries and wounds and performing the right method of applying CPR. What emergency steps to take if we are being bitten by snakes or accidentally ate a poisonous fruit while doing trekking in a forested area. We had two members who are retired nurses and they were so keen to share their experiences and demonstrate the various first aid techniques. The whole sharing took us about 45 mins and everyone had their hands on._x000D_
_x000D_
After the first aid training, we took our thongs and commenced our anti-littering picking activities with our trash bags. The areas at the summit was perfectly clean except for some little papers here and there. There were many visitors on that weekend but we hardly see much litters along the way. Occasionally, someone dropped some little papers along the way up and we were happily picking them up. The message we are sending to our members is Love our parks and gardens and it is our duty to maintain it clean and green. All of us love nature, love the fresh air, love the green and beautiful scenery and we have to play our part in keeping this country clean at all times._x000D_

After the shows we spent the rest of our night walking round the 4 walking trails and trying to spot all the animals._x000D_

375919213,2016-05-24 00:00:00.000,5,A CHURCH WITH A HEART,"Physical churches where established for people of God to worship. I was fortunate to visit the Singaporeâ€™s most famous church. I was awed by the grandeur and elegant facade of the church. The simplicity of the interior made me pray and kneel before God. Thank you was not enough considering that this was my second time to visit Singapore. Singapore made me realized that the world is not only Philippines; that there was a bigger arena for me to explore and wander.

_x000D_
Yes, they have covered parking which most of the museums in Singapore do not offer._x000D_
_x000D_
Yes, they have discounts available if you're a Singtel Subscriber. Just show them your phone and the Singtel logo to get a discount for the entrance fees._x000D_
_x000D_
Note, that if you want to see everything you will need to pay extra for the various exhibitions that rotate through the National Gallery from quarter to quarter._x000D_
_x000D_
There are restaurants in the Gallery, many of them, are of the sit down, fine dining variety which are only open a few hours at lunch, and again at dinner, so if you're there mid to late afternoon you may go hungry. To check their hours and down load a map to your phone, go to Nationalgallery.sg web site._x000D_

We arrived around 1:30 and meandered through some of the Singapore historical galleries. These galleries contain a wonderfully diverse collection of paintings, etchings, drawings, photographs, sculptures and artifacts from colonial days up through the 60's._x000D_
_x000D_
As we were unaware of the limited dining hours, we managed to get a table at Violet Oons for a late lunch (see separate review)._x000D_
_x000D_
After lunch, we continued to the paid exhibition, entitled ""Arist and Empire, (En)Countering Colonial Legacies."" This exhibition included a varied collection of works reflecting numerous artists interpretations, from both sides (colonists and colonized) of life during colonial times throughout Asia and India. It was well worth the money paid._x000D_

We also spent some time just checking out the place, admiring the modern additions and updates to these beautiful, old buildings. I especially liked the roof top water garden which creates dancing shadows throughout the interior spaces and beautiful reflecting ponds on the top floor. The top floor offers great views and photo ops of the Padang, where the 7's rugby matches are held, the Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands, and of course, the ever changing Singapore skyline.

It is possible to see the Gardens by the Bay free if you are going through the outdoor sections of the area. However the main attractions of the area are the two ticketed indoor conservatories, namely the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. For the nature lover, this will be the place for you. You can get to see different varieties of flowers from different continents at the Flower Dome conservatory, while the Cloud Mountain waterfall at the Cloud Forest conservatory should not be missed. Depending of the time you visit, there may be special exhibitions as well, such as during Christmas._x000D_

We were trekking in the anti-clockwise direction and it is mainly descending on this Loop to finally join back to the Dairy Farm Nature Park.

But after 24 years, it brings back fond memories where almost everything looks the same but maintained well._x000D_
Lots of things to see, many halls to discover. My one complaint is the exhibits could have more of a reaction after the kids press the buttons. Some of the buttons pushed had little or even dull activations. Kids want to see things light up to keep their attention. Some didnt work at all. The kid in me was disappointed. I suppose it is a lot of work to do on each exhibit and it takes a lot to engage kids nowadays. Especially the iPad generation._x000D_
But i have nothing to moan about as it was very good value for money where me and my son as locals paid only $6 for me and $4 for him._x000D_
Highlight was that crazy mirror maze, thought itd be easy but was quite a challenge and i got a bit of a panic attack as we went deeper and deeper into it. Had to keep cool for my boy but i was like omg omg omg. We managed to escape. I mean exit. Weirdly, reminded me of my first marriage._x000D_

Now to the nitty gritty part of the experience. Firstly you have to book a time you want to attend but I really think that doesnâ€™t matter as itâ€™s a mad house when you actually turn up on the night. There are massive lines to get on the trams, so you could be waiting a long time... The best thing I recommend to do is walk to the feeding as by the time you get on the tram youâ€™ll probably miss it. So get there nice and early and go to the feedings and thereâ€™s also other shows on that we missed as they were all booked out by the time you got on the tram and back again._x000D_

Our guide, Diah, was really friendly and very knowledgable during the tour. You are walked through the bunker areas, including strategic rooms and living spaces, and there are also some video presentations about the invasion of Malaya and the defence of Singapore before its invasion. I will say that the tour is quite lenient and sympathetic to the British army officers' situation, and focuses purely on the Japanese invasion and the surrender of the British. Due to the bunker's original purpose, of course the tour does not go into depth about the Japanese occupation of Singapore, or the eventual liberation of the island. This is a good overview of the start of the war in Singapore, and then there are other places to go to learn about the later war years._x000D_

Far from it - I'm joining the hype. Absolutely wonderful gardens and the two domes are a stroke of genius. I was awestruck by the beauty of the domes and such a wonderful sanctuary to escape the Singapore heat. Both domes are a very pleasant temperature and humidity and it would be easy to stay there all day. Cloud dome is awe-inspiring. A tip for the cloud dome! Essentially you walk along a path and then take a lift to the top and walk along aerial paths and other exhibits on your way back down to where they might expect you to exit. Well that's the psychological idea to keep the crowds moving (and out). Once you are about to exit the dome, if you walk around to the right (and this is not sign posted) you come across the lift that can take you back up to the top. You're actually a level below where you got in!_x000D_

but then again, I was just a snotty little kid when I last visited a wildlife attraction that barely got me interested._x000D_
Fate brought me to the Singapore Zoo and immediately thought the place was amazing. They have a pair of the rare white tigers, collection of birds, mammals that even include a polar bear, other big cats, and playful elephants (that you can ride for a fee). You can get up close to giant reptiles that are at the top of their food chain, and more assortment of rainforest eco-community surrounded by just mere (sometimes inexistent) fences._x000D_
Really an exhilarating experience._x000D_
The place is huge & closes by afternoon (for the night safari), so my advice is, get there early to have a more complete tour of this animal kingdom that you just mostly see on the Animal Planet, Discovery Ch. or Nat Geo._x000D_
It'll also give you the opportunity to watch and even participate with the feeding segments. If you happen to visit during summer and unfortunately suffer cramps from a lot of walking, you can take the tram, or the boat to get to places within the park._x000D_

There are also restaurants for you to recuperate, refresh and get back on the trail to see the animals and the animal shows._x000D_

First time to visit. We booked 20:15 one and got there around 19:45, however, the waiting line for the tram was already super long, and it took us 45 mins to start the tour._x000D_
The worst part is that we couldn't attend the Creatures of the Night Show._x000D_
Our tram tour finished just before 21:30, and we rush to the show, but the staff said the show is full and we couldn't attend._x000D_
This is VERY unprofessional._x000D_
A woman, who also couldn't attend the show, was claiming that why they sell so many ticket and many people cannot enjoy the show even though the ticket price is same._x000D_
That is so true._x000D_
We paid same price, and some could enjoy the show and some couldn't._x000D_
21:30 is the last show of the weekday._x000D_
_x000D_
I went there with my guest who came over from Japan and she was VERY disappointed. Me too._x000D_
This is what they should announce more clearly._x000D_
If you want to enjoy the show, go there by 19:00, and enjoy show from 19:30, then get on the tram tour from 20:15, and enjoy walking trail till the safari is closed._x000D_
This is only the way you can enjoy all of the safari. I hope you don't waste money._x000D_

403920656,2016-08-11 00:00:00.000,3,Beautiful but still a zoo,"I have to admit that my expectations of Singapore zoo were quite high as most reviews of the zoo are very complimentary._x000D_
This zoo is very beautiful as it is surrounded by rainforest gardens which are beautifully maintained. Some of the exhibits are quite clever such as the free ranging orangutan exhibit that is above one of the main walkway intersections. I also thought the ethiopian monkey exhibit was quite good although some of the monkeys looked liked they required medical attention. Most of the exhibits were very small and I personally felt that most needed to be at least 4 times the size. We also checked out the elephant show, that supposedly showed the ""bond between mahoot and elephant."" All I saw were men with hooks on sticks ( the hooks were disguised by having ribbon tied on them), exerting their will on the elephants. For a zoo that preaches the 5 freedoms of animals, having a show where the keepers hook the animals by the skin or behind the ear to get them to perform tricks for people, seems quite contradictory._x000D_
This zoo also educates the public about the destruction of rainforests which is good but as most of the snacks in the zoo contain palm oil, it's another case of do as I say not not as I do. I think this zoo needs to focus on the message it's sending and lead by example instead of taking the easy path and pretending to be unaware of what is being sold or what behaviour is happening within its park._x000D_
We took our 6 year old and the highlight of her visit was the waterpark. It's a great idea and a welcome respite after a hot day walking around the zoo. The flooring is very tired and needs replacing though as it has large pieces missing from it. I also liked the child pulling wagons and thought they were a great idea.",2016-08-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-26 12:16:55.106,Eddie0101,Australia,Singapore Zoo,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",admit expectation singapore zoo quite high review zoo complimentaryxd zoo beautiful surround rainforest garden beautifully maintain exhibit quite clever free range orangutan exhibit one main walkway intersection also thought ethiopian monkey exhibit quite good although monkey look like require medical attention exhibit small personally felt need least time size also checked elephant show supposedly show bond mahoot elephant saw men hook stick hook disguise ribbon tie exert elephant zoo preaches freedom animal show keeper hook animal skin behind ear get perform trick people seem quite contradictoryxd zoo also educates public destruction rainforest good snack zoo contain palm oil another case say not not think zoo need focus message send lead example instead take easy path pretend unaware sell behaviour happen within parkxd take year old highlight visit waterpark great idea welcome respite hot day walk around zoo floor tire need replace though large piece miss also like child pull wagon thought great idea

556960853,2018-01-29 00:00:00.000,5,Lovely walks through woodland to the skywalk through the treetops,"There is a large area of woodland around the MacRitchie reservoir, with many paths. We only walked from the main car park to the Skywalk (about 45 mins walk for fit adults, not stopping to take many pictures, longer with children or keen photographers!), over the Skywalk and then back round via the Tower. The paths through the woods are great, there are lots of monkeys, best to watch them while keeping walking, if you stand still too long they start to come a bit too close! Great to see them jumping across the walkway. The bridge through the tree tops is great, with terrific views. Note you can only go one direction across it, so have to come back via a circular route. There are lots of other paths that we didn't take, but may some other time._x000D_
To get there, we took the bus 410 from Bishan interchange. There is 410G and 410W which basically go opposite ways round a loop. I think it is approx at the far point of the loop, so probably doesn't matter too much which you get. Ask the driver for Upper Thompson Rd (same price to all stops on that road, so you don't need to say more than that). We took the 410G and stayed on till nearly the end of Upper Thomson Rd, we got off by the petrol station. If you stay on longer than that, the bus turns right at the crossroads, where the MacRitchie is to the left. The shop at the petrol station sells drinks, crisps, cakes, so you can get a minimal picnic from it (the lady serving was very friendly). We caught the 410W back from the other side of the road. The buses go pretty regularly (every 15 mins or so, I think?)_x000D_

- If you're looking for a good spot to watch the light & sound show in the evening, after leaving the station follow the signs leading to the main parts of the Garden until you see a lake on your right. Stop there and appreciate the show._x000D_
- Prepare yourself for the trip according to the weather conditions. Personally, I preferred to visit the Gardens when it was cloudy. On a dry and sunny day I wasn't even able to reach the Gardens' entrance - it was too hot and the stroll wouldn't have been enjoyable at all._x000D_

436297717,2016-11-11 00:00:00.000,4,Good visit with senior citizens and infant,"We (2 adults, 2 senior citizens and 1 infant) visited the zoo on a Saturday. Since the zoo is not easily accessible by MRT (required multiple hops from Tanah Merah, where I live) we chose to go by taxi. The taxi dropped us right at the main entrance (about 8:25 AM) - very convenient._x000D_
_x000D_
We entered the zoo and were handed maps by the eager staff. The map was quite informative, and we chose to walk in the direction suggested by the map. We visited the otters through the rain forest walk, followed by the primates section. The enclosures of the animals seemed to be well maintained and we were able to see the animals right away._x000D_
_x000D_
We then proceeded to Ah Meng restaurant for a breakfast with the orangutans. We had to pay a steep price of S$35 per person for an entry. Also, infant strollers/prams were not allowed and had to be kept outside. The buffet menu itself had quite the variety, both veg and non-veg items, and multiple cuisines. As we managed to reach the restaurant by 8:30, we were able to enjoy breakfast in peace. The orangutans came to their pre designated place at 9:30 and after a brief introduction everyone had to line up for a photo with them. A good option would be to reach early, have breakfast and be ready by the time orangutans come. That way you won't have to leave your breakfast in between. We had to wait a short while in the line for taking pictures with the orangutans. The photographers did let you take pictures with your mobiles, so it was not mandatory to buy the professional pictures._x000D_
_x000D_
There's a small area out this restaurant that has a play area for children. This was well appreciated, as we could let our (wiggling) daughter down for some free stretches._x000D_
_x000D_
Following the great outing with the orangutans, we proceeded to the 'splash safari' show. It was quite a well rehearsed and applaud worthy performance and was enjoyed by one and all. The show was in a covered stepped auditorium with the sea lions performing at the bottom. Front row people may get wet with the sea lions splashing water._x000D_
_x000D_
Once the show was done, our planned itinerary was sppoiled a bit by unprecedented heavy rains. Luckily there was a covered pathway near the splash safari show (not all places have covered pathways). We had to wait in the covered pathway for about 45 min, and then proceded to other areas of the zoo._x000D_
_x000D_
For lunch, we had packed and taken our lunch with us. We had lunch in 'Pavillion by the lake' in the Australian Zone. The lunch area is a big open covered space (with few ceiling fans not working). Plastic chairs have been provided for sitting, but it was not very convenient to sit with your lunch box in your hand. The area was clean, however. Enough to let our daughter crawl on the floor._x000D_
_x000D_
The zoo is well equipped with diaper changing stations, and benches to sit (particularly for the elderly). There aren't many places where you could let a 12 month infant (crawling age) down for a stretch. The zoo also provides a tram facility, however we preffered to walk. The tram would have been useful during a drizzle (not particularly useful during heavy rains, as it is open). Be aware that a lot of walking is required around the zoo and hence carrying some rehydrating liquids would be recommended._x000D_
_x000D_
Once we came out of the zoo (about 4 PM), we faced a slight inconvenience of transportation back home. Expect a minimum waiting time of 20 min at the taxi stand. Not all taxis will come to the area that you want to go. So your wait in the queue might be extended. Albeit, the zoo runs a free shuttle to the nearest MRT station, from where you can possibly take multiple MRTs elsewhere. With senior citizens and an infant, this option was not particularly sought after by us. But I wanted to make a note that the zoo had made some provisions. After a reasonably long wait in the taxi queue, we managed to get one and started our journey back home, tired but satisfied with what the zoo had to offer.",2016-10-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-26 12:12:50.242,Amit T,Singapore,Singapore Zoo,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",adult senior citizen infant visit zoo saturday since zoo not easily accessible mrt require multiple hop tanah merah live chose go taxi taxi drop u right main entrance convenientxd xd enter zoo hand map eager staff map quite informative chose walk direction suggest map visit otter rain forest walk follow primate section enclosure animal seem well maintain able see animal right awayxd xd proceed ah meng restaurant breakfast orangutan pay steep price per person entry also infant strollersprams not allow kept outside buffet menu quite variety veg non veg item multiple cuisine manage reach restaurant able enjoy breakfast peace orangutan come pre designate place brief introduction everyone line photo good option would reach early breakfast ready time orangutan come way not leave breakfast wait short line take picture orangutan photographer let take picture mobile not mandatory buy professional picturesxd xd small area restaurant play area child well appreciate could let wiggle daughter free stretchesxd xd follow great out orangutan proceed splash safari show quite well rehearse applaud worthy performance enjoy one show cover step auditorium sea lion perform bottom front row people may get wet sea lion splash waterxd xd show do plan itinerary sppoiled bit unprecedented heavy rain luckily cover pathway near splash safari show not place cover pathway wait cover pathway min proceded area zooxd xd lunch packed take lunch u lunch pavillion lake australian zone lunch area big open cover space ceiling fan not work plastic chair provide sit not convenient sit lunch box hand area clean however enough let daughter crawl floorxd xd zoo well equip diaper change station bench sit particularly elderly not many place could let month infant crawl age stretch zoo also provide tram facility however preffered walk tram would useful drizzle not particularly useful heavy rain open aware lot walk require around zoo hence carry rehydrating liquid would recommendedxd xd come zoo pm face slight inconvenience transportation back home expect minimum wait time min taxi stand not taxi come area want go wait queue might extend albeit zoo run free shuttle near mrt station possibly take multiple mrts elsewhere senior citizen infant option not particularly sought u want make note zoo make provision reasonably long wait taxi queue manage get one start journey back home tire satisfied zoo offer
