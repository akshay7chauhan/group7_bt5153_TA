The only clue there was anything inside the mound was a door with a padlock on it - as the guide said ""looking a bit like a garden shed"". Finally, a journalist, having heard rumours of something under the hill, broke the padlock and found this historic series of chambers which housed the British WWII Underground Command Centre. It was inside one of these underground rooms that the historic decision was made to surrender Singapore to the Japanese, in the hope of saving the lives of many soldiers and civilians. Entrance is by guided tour only, and the entrance money helps support the maintenance of the site. Our guide, Jerome, certainly knew his facts, and communicated it to us all in a very clear manner.

We only had a few hours in transit in Singapore, so decided to leave the airport and head to the Gardens. It was a wonderful couple of hours and one we would highly recommend. The Flower Dome was a spectacular display of colour and plant variety. We loved the gardens from around the world, that included plants from Australia, South Africa, North America and Europe. The colourful displays of tulips were delightful (one of my favourite flowers). The Cloud Dome was lush and green with fantastic views of the plants from the raised walkways. The views of Singapore from the ""clouds"" was also great as was the ecological message. Both domes had many wooden sculptures to admire, and being climate controlled was quite cool inside, so an extra layer of clothing might be needed for some people. The $28 fee is very reasonable for such an amazing attraction, even from an engineering point of view. The outside areas of the garden are free to explore. We didn't have much time to explore outside. I suggest two visits to the Gardens would be ideal - one in the day (for those keen on photography) and one in the evening for the lights.

After the tram part of the tour, youâ€™ll be able to take yourself along the walking route, which is split into 4 parts, but very simple to follow. This part was really nice as you could go at your own pace and read all the information labels that tell you about the animals and their habitats. As it got later, at times we felt alone in the jungle - a really memorable feeling. Staff were positioned mainly to guide you in the right directions, but whenever we spoke to any of them, they knew lots of details about their animals._x000D_

We were lucky enough to visit on a sunny day, which helped in capturing the beauty in some photos. The colours of the trees and size cannot be captured in photos so this is a must see for those in Singapore. Visiting the gardens is free entry and i recommend walking around the entire place to ensure you don't miss anything. To see the gardens in free entry, however to see inside the two conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) and entry for the skywalk incurs a fee, but these are definitely recommended to visit. May be worthwhile to check online for closure dates for the conservatories, because we arrived one day and the cloud forest was closed for maintenance.

From whole sensory rooms with surround interactive light shows to pictures you colour then scan and upload to interactive walls.

The park itself is free but donâ€™t miss out on Flower Dome and Cloud Forest even though they have an entrance fee of around 20 USD (in total for both). A recommendation would be to arrive during the afternoon perhaps around 4 pm and walk around the park and do Flower Dome and Cloud Forest which will take you at least 3h. If it is hot outside you can go in the domes and cool off (you might need an extra sweater inside as it can be a bit cold after a while). Then in the evening you stick around and catch the free light show at Supertree Grove which starts at 7.45 and 8.45 pm. Be there a little earlier if you want to get a good viewing spot.

After the show, we left for the tram ride which showed other animals in a more or less natural habitat. Many of these animals are endangered, and this zoo has worked to help preserve them with breeding programs. Only the tiger was sequestered, but he was active as we went by.

It took three hours and we are reasonably fit and walked at a medium pace. My advice is start early ( even though under the canopy of the rainforest it is noticeably cooler) as it was really hot at midday when we finished.

_x000D_
I remember when I was little my parents would bring my siblings and I there to feed the fish and swans (not so encouraged these days because the park wardens don't want the animals to get sick). So those times were wonderful times of simple fun._x000D_
_x000D_
Then when I was older, I brought my girlfriend there for many of our dates - she loves being near nature, and plants just make her happy. So the place became our favourite for long romantic walks in he evenings._x000D_
_x000D_
Well, eventually I married her :) And when the kids came along, SBC became one of our favourite places for family picnics and enjoying the free musical performances at the stage area. It was also a useful place to visit for the kids' botany projects from school. I still remember spending hours with them taking photos of different kinds of plant categories - and there are many, many varieties to study there!!_x000D_
_x000D_
And now, the kids have all grown up, and I hear they sometimes go there for their dates with their special someone too! My wife and I still enjoy going there on our dates, and our favorite places are the Cool House and the Orchid Garden._x000D_
_x000D_
So yes, whether you are a resident in Singapore, or you are a visitor, I would recommend SBC as a ""must see"" - for the huge variety of plant life to learn from, for a romantic hiatus (especially in the evenings when it is cooler), for a place to bring the kids and the dog and to let them loose, or just a place to find some solace from the madness of everyday life.",2015-12-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-26 10:05:31.542,ATKA166,Singapore,Singapore Botanic Gardens,Leisure & Recreation,"1 Cluny Road, Singapore 259 569, Singapore",0.0,0.769,0.231,0.5994,0.019,0.805,0.176,0.9942

2. Cloud Forest : It is also a huge superbly air conditioned greenhouse but with a big waterfall inside and walkway bridge from 7th floor. It also has science museum. Once you enter this place, you will be greeted by a huge artificial waterfall. Then you have to take elevator to go the top floor from where you can walk in the bridge toward the downstairs._x000D_

3. OCBC SkyWay : This is a glass bridge connecting the super grove tress. You can take 15-30 minutes walk on this . You can get good view of overall garden and Singapore city from here. But preferred time is 7:30-7:45pm when there will be light show._x000D_

374639866,2016-05-20 00:00:00.000,5,"Stunning With a Twist, And An Amazing Example Of What You Can Do With Money","When I was last in Singapore in December 2010 this area was just a building site, indeed having got lost in the middle of it at that time I can tell you that I had trouble finding my way out of it.... See the photos_x000D_
_x000D_
At the time I asked someone what they were doing and was told ''Building a garden'' which did not really at the time explain the futuristic buildings which looked more like a sports building of some sort._x000D_
_x000D_
Now it is finished all becomes clear and just shows what can you can do when you throw 60 million US$ or so, at a project. I bet the Cranbourne Botanic Garden in Melbourne wishes they had that kind of money to throw around!_x000D_
_x000D_
Bearing in mind that dry land is at something of a premium in_x000D_
Singapore and bearing in mind that they already had the exquisite National Botanic Garden, a World Heritage site, it seems to be odd building another Botanic Garden, but this garden is for everyone so it is a botanic garden without the labels on the plants!_x000D_
_x000D_
The whole area is huge and is more of a pleasure ground to be visited over and over and as such has a children's area, an eating area, and so on. Plus the futuristic vertical gardens which remind me of the old movie version of The Time Machine although am not sure why._x000D_
_x000D_
Right in the middle are the two ''Domes'', one of which is the Flower Dome which is pretty self explanatory, and the other is The Cloud Forest Dome. While the gardens outside are free these two centrepieces will cost you extra, for my money the Cloud Forest is the better deal._x000D_
_x000D_
Doing the easy one first, probably the first things that hits you in the Flower Dome is the scent of flowers, but you have to remember that flowers don't last forever so what you see will vary, while I was there the main theme was the Dahlia Exhibition, but many of the displays are permanent with mini botanic gardens from South Africa, Australasia, and the Americas._x000D_
_x000D_
For me the piece de resistance was without a doubt The Cloud Forest Dome, inside the visitor is greeted with what can only be described as an awe inspiring scene rising almost to the very roof of the dome itself and accessible by lifts and walkways which take you up to the tops and bring you slowly back down again on foot (wheelchair access is brilliant by the way)._x000D_
_x000D_
There is also a rather disturbing exhibition/animation of the effect that global warming is having on our environment especially the cloud forests which are just as important as the rain forests._x000D_
_x000D_
I am not going to spoil the fun too much here but of you want a good tip for the Cloud Forest Dome make sure that your camera or smartphone is covered as you walk in!_x000D_

Enjoying the â€œsong of the treesâ€ is worthwhile. There are two schedules with one hour difference between them. Trying the sky bridge was a good experience indeed and it didnâ€™t cost much too!

When entering the gate, youâ€™ll immediately notice the stunning main hall with its high ceiling. It is located at 288 South Bridge St. It opens at 7am and closes at 7pm and is free of charge. The bell tower and drum tower are on the same floor. However, the main focus for most visitors is the solid gold two-metre stupa on the fourth floor which is the place where the sacred relic is kept. Continuing up to the roof, there is a pagoda that has a large prayer wheel. A mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Hinduism and Buddhism, representing the universe and the temple is built based on this symbol. Tours are available and take about 1 hour. There is a little teahouse located on the second floor which is a nice place to relax after the tour. Tea and some vegetarian cuisine is served. The temple holds ceremonies on a daily basis; visitors are allowed to take photos, even during services. Avoid off-the-shoulder T-shirts, shorts and mini-skirts as dress with respectful attire is required when visiting the temple.",2017-02-01 00:00:00.000,Friends,2020-01-30 00:26:54.757,Dodgemcars,Australia,Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum,"Art, History & Culture","288 South Bridge Road, Singapore 058840, Singapore",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.5859,0.011,0.888,0.101,0.9485

You literally just walk into the site past the Dragonfly Pond - and keep walking in whatever direction you want, via the myriad paths and grassed areas. The flora and fauna is fascinating (though largely unsigned, so lacking a bit of information) and the people watching is just as interesting, especially in the more central open spaces. DO take the sky-walk - relatively cheap, no stairs involved and BRILLIANT views back to the city, and across Singapore Bay. Not for the faint-hearted though, or those with any fear of heights! I did not, on this occasion, go in the geodomes. I cannot imagine how hot it would be inside the rain-forest biosphere...The great thing outside is the proximity of so many shaded areas, plenty of seating, little footfall, and so the ability to take as much time as you want, resting, taking on water and enjoying the vistas._x000D_

Not many know that Raffles himself was a keen naturalist, and he developed the first â€˜Botanical and Experimental Gardenâ€™ at Fort Canning. In 1859, all his efforts culminated in the founding of the Gardens at its present site. The Botanic Gardens is als connected with Lond's Kew Gardens because Kew-trained botanists had a hand in its development in its early days. As the main place from which the harvesting of the rubber tree was researched, it also played a pivotal role in the early economy of Malaysia._x000D_

My first activity I wanted to experience and share our special moment was with Singapore Flyer, and that never took place. Two weeks before our trip I received an automated e-mail stating due to technical difficulties the Flyer was not operational. We were given the option to immediately cancel or wait. As this was once in a lifetime trip, I was hopeful and waited. Three days later a second e-mail informing me the Flyer would likely not be operational and they would process a refund. IF YOU BOOK IN ADVANCE, YOU PAY AT TIME OF BOOKING. I have no issue with that to secure special events such as dinner or slings on board. When they cancel, you are informed refunds take 6 to 8 WEEKS. Unacceptable. Airlines refund quicker than this and they are notorious for cancellations._x000D_
_x000D_
When we arrived in Singapore we learned more about the technical difficulties from locals. We also were informed management has changed in recent years and more ""technical difficulties"" have occurred where the Flyer is not operational. Two different tour operators told us they have recommended against bookings as this has become more recent with financial issues. Initially I would have thought ""that's just tour operators steering visitors to other things."" Then we visited the Singapore Flyer grounds. It was deserted, on a weekend afternoon less than 10 people we saw around the sprawling area of the Flyer. There has to be some validity if everyone is keeping away, and it's a shame. I always thought of the Flyer as an icon of Singapore. Yes, it's still lit at night and that's beautiful (hence 2 star and not 1). There is no timeline to get the Flyer operational, instead the same message is repeated on technical difficulties. If that's the case, be transparent and don't process refunds in 6 to 8 weeks. If guests are required to pay up front for bookings, finances should be in order to reimburse._x000D_

For someone in a wheelchair, the air conditioned domes are a wonderful respite from the Singapore heat. The Flower Dome has great access - the slopes are gentle and you can pretty much see everything from the wheelchair.

What surprised me was the Cloud Dome. I only found 1 lift to negotiate the different levels. The suspended walkways are broad enough for the wheelchair, but there were many levels that required traveling on the escalators. Given that the 1 lift was used by parents with prams, and wheelchairs like mine, it took so long for me to get anywhere, I eventually gave up and decided to wait for my friends at the ground level. To my horror, the final lift down to the ground floor brought me OUT of the Dome, and I had to backtrack to meet my friends before coming back out again. Let's just say it was not ideal, especially compared to how wheelchair friendly the rest of the Gardens was.

We went up to the Skyway around sunset so the view and the sky was spectacular. We also stay up there till itâ€™s fully dark to capture photos of the light trees when theyâ€™re on._x000D_

The light show starts at 7:45pm and 8:45pm if I remembered correctly. This to me is the highlight of the whole visit to the Gardens. Do bring a picnic blanket so you could spread it on the ground and lie down to fully enjoy the light show._x000D_

You can see the behavior of many of the animals is very similar to what is expected of them in the wild. Also the number of animals is much more than I anticipated (there's even polar bear and penguins). You may need an entire day to explore it completely. There are proper sheds over walkways, so you don't have to worry about cover if it rains and you didn't bring an umbrella. Special events are also organised for some of the animals where they do some stunts and other stuff (don't worry, it's perfectly safe for the animals). One of the other highlights was ""Zoorasic park""- as they call it, where they have robotic dinosaurs, it's pretty cool as they look pretty realistic. You have choice on how you want to explore the zoo- on foot or open mini bus type vehicles (don't remember the exact name).

It is surprising that they are not using their experience to improve the experience for the visitors._x000D_
_x000D_
It starts right at the entrance - preference is given to those who have group bookings - they don't wait in the Q but walk in at their convenience. We bought our tickets directly and had to stand in the Q for almost 45 minutes. The management should understand that non-group booking people also contribute to their profits._x000D_
_x000D_
There is one Q for checking the tickets. As you are going in, you are made to wait another 30 minutes. And there is no seating - you are just standing there in multiple lines, while watching the Group booking people stroll in. And finally, there is another wait in Q for scanning your tickets and entering the area. Once you are in, there is another long Q for the tram ride. And it is frustrating as all those group booking people are again ahead of you in the tram Q. We realised that the staff there is more interested in keeping tour operators happy rather than those who come directly / do their own planning._x000D_
_x000D_
We went to see Creatures of the Night - a pathetic show put on by the staff. Please don't waste you time on it._x000D_
_x000D_
Please factor in another 30 minutes wait before you can board the tram. It was again poorly managed as we saw many trams leaving with empty seats - surprising as there was a long Q. And in many seats, we saw just a couple sitting where as the capacity of a row is 4 people - they could easily fit in 2 couples each and clear the Q faster._x000D_

After the tram ride, we did the walk around. We could hardly see any additional animals on the walk around - we saw most of them on the tram ride._x000D_

Situated in the Marina Bay area iit is one of the newer attractions envisioned by the Government to bring in the much needed visitors. Singapore has no natual resources and require tourist arrivals to bring in revenue._x000D_
_x000D_
The Gardens have several features of interest. We went to two of them, the Cloud Forest and Skyway. Besides these two popular sections are the Supertrees and Flower Dome._x000D_
_x000D_
The SuperTree Grove was stunning. The trees were 164 feet tall and covered with greenery. A Very lovely and refreshing site. They are right at the entrance and showcase a modern Singapore._x000D_
_x000D_
The Cloud Forest is equally stunning with its huge climate controlled glass dome housing several varities of green plants. The Flower Dome, which we didn't visit, is said to be a burst of colour with flowers from several countries. We also enjoyed the cool sprays from the artificial waterfall and walking along the 3km long pathway along the Bay._x000D_
_x000D_
We were rushed for time and so could not wait for the light display at 7.45 pm. Do not miss that as I am reliably informed that it is nothing but spectacular!_x000D_
_x000D_
We were a bit disappointed that the Cloud Forest and SuperTrees were almost monochrome, green. I wish they had some colourful flowers here as well._x000D_
_x000D_
For those of you who have knee problems, be warned that there is a lot of walking to do. However, there is wheel chair access throughout for those who need it._x000D_
_x000D_
Tickets can be bought either directly from the Gardens or at a discount from online agents --We paid 20% less. But some offer even lower rates, less 25% or lower. We were not too sure how reliable these agents were and decided to go by an agent whose address and contact nos were given. This agent turned out fine as I had to call her several times regarding mode of payment, etc to which the woman answered patiently. These tickets were accepted at the Entrance!_x000D_
_x000D_
One could easily spend about three hours at the Gardens. There are some food outlets and other facilities to make the visitors comfortable._x000D_
The best months to visit are November to March when the open garden areas are so breezy. However, it is the rainy season too and it is advisable to carry an umbrella._x000D_
_x000D_

_x000D_
My review may appear contrary to what people are 'expecting' about Night Safari._x000D_
_x000D_
Being an Animal/Nature Lover, the word Safari, for me, is filled with a lot of sight-seeing and excitement and lots of animals in their wild best! The Night Safari at Singapore Zoo did not invoke any of those feelings. It turned out to be a Damp squib._x000D_
_x000D_
It was more Drama and less Reality. There is nothing unique that was showcased at this event._x000D_
_x000D_
The long Queues to get into the Tram made it worse._x000D_
_x000D_
There is nothing worthwhile to remember about this Safari._x000D_
_x000D_
Its Just another way for the Zoo to earn a little more money by giving a ""night safari"" tag to an extremely boring Tram ride._x000D_
_x000D_
There was a Fire show/stunt at the Entrance of Night Safari, which was good, but it is a totally ""disconnected"" event and i am wondering why it needs to be there at the Night Safari._x000D_
_x000D_
And then there was an Animal Show, where a few nocturnal animals were ""displayed""._x000D_
_x000D_
This show was high on Drama (and Rhetoric) and low on Animals/birds or their activities. Its a total waste of time. The Presenter of this Show was the only Saving grace and the only thing good to talk about this show. Nothing else is good about this animal show._x000D_
_x000D_
I have seen extremely engaging animal shows at other Zoos that almost captivate you and make you look forward for an another show!_x000D_

I must add here that the experience at the Day Zoo was just the Opposite, it was an extremely awesome experience. I highly recommend you to visit the Zoo during the day instead._x000D_

The aquarium was probably the most interesting room to me. You make a drawing of a sea creature and insert it into a machine which scans the image and animates it onto a screen that looks like an aquarium. As you get close to the animated drawing it swims away from you. It blew my mind and I'm sure this description does not do it justice. There was also a graffiti art show here with the original Sheppard Fairy Obama screen print as well as his Obey posters and a plethora of other artists. there was even a wall you could tag on or put stickers on.

677233159,2019-05-29 00:00:00.000,5,What you'd expect...,"...from a National Museum. Actually it kind of started out on a bit of a (I'm really struggling for a word here) unexpected note. After purchasing my ticket, I was directed to an escalator that took me to the the top of the building's rotonda where you wind your way back down viewing a digital display of a forest (which I guess is Singapore back in the day). It was certainly colorful, visually pleasing, and the kids running back and forth seemed to love it. I guess for me, when I go to a museum (especially a national one), I'm expecting to see realia as opposed to basically digital animation. Then again, it's a nice wow factor for the kids. That didn't last long as you find yourself on the bottom floor in the main historical gallery of the museum covering the breadth of Singapore's history. Here is where I found the great displays and information panels I wanted. Too much to go into about what is displayed, but my visit to the museum today left me a question in my mind. A big part of the main historical gallery covers both the British colonial period as well as the Japanese occupation during WWII. There is even a separate display about the Japanese occupation; I believe it was on the second floor of the museum. What I found interesting was that these displays on the Japanese occupation really bring to life the horror that occurred during this period. Yet for the most part, the British colonial is sort of viewed through rose-colored glasses. Yes there are disturbing displays about things such as how the colonial British ""encouraged"" opium addiction, but I would think colonial occupation to be just as horrific, maybe even more debilitating, and certainly more insidious then a much shorter period of wartime occupation. I am certainly not trying to minimize the responsibility of the Japanese for their war crimes, it's just that I left the museum wondering why the scope of the British colonial period is not viewed in a similar manner.",2019-05-01 00:00:00.000,Solo,2020-01-29 19:41:34.154,scottofhawaii,Japan,National Museum of Singapore,"Art, History & Culture","93 Stamford Road National Museum of Singapore, Singapore 178897, Singapore",0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.064,0.849,0.086,0.1787

Like exploring Southeast Asian culture?!,"If the answer to any of the above is, ""Yes"", then you should definitely consider visiting the National Gallery of Singapore. It's easy to get to. Several MRT stations are nearby but City Hall is closest - and that is probably because half of the Gallery is housed within the old City Hall. The other half of the Gallery is in the adjacent Supreme Court Building. From the outside both buildings demonstrate their colonial majesty admirably (and are designated national monuments) but were converted into a terrific, flexible art and culture space in 2015. The interiors itself is worth the admission fee alone!_x000D_
_x000D_
But, of course, art is the real draw. The Gallery hosts the world's largest public collection of Singaporean and Southeast Asian art. Spanning many different eras, styles, media and ethnic origin, the collection is rich and, to be honest, my wife and I failed to get round everything in our first trip. We will be back though!_x000D_
_x000D_
If you are in Singapore for only a short time and only have a couple of hours to visit I would recommend one of the free guided tours. These are mostly delivered by highly knowledgeable docents and appear to run on the hour (late morning into the afternoon), covering different exhibits. We attended one tour and it was a great way to dive into some the Gallery's highlight works._x000D_

For a few years I have been supporting charities caring for them in Borneo & Sumatra. I don't believe that such animals should be in zoos but, unfortunately I'm no longer able to trek through forests due to age & health. So the Singapore Zoo seemed the best & most humane option. It's a long way out of town. We took a taxi. Between two it was not too expensive. Then there's the zoo admission & the breakfast charge. So for a family quite an investment. If you'd like a souvenir photo with the orangs that another $25. No obligation to buy though. The breakfast looked to be quite substantial, but as we'd had breakfast at our hotel we just picked at a few items. By a stroke of luck we were seated in the front row so had a perfect view. And the orangutans? Such beautiful sentient creatures. The decline in their numbers due to palm oil cultivation is an absolute tragedy. Seeing them in the flesh was a dream come true.

To get there we took a bus from Beach Road, needing one change for around $7. It was the end of rush hour so pick your timing carefully. The 2nd bus went straight to the entrance._x000D_
We arrived around 8.45, in time to see the fire show, then walked straight onto a tram, less than half full, with no queue. The 40min tour was good, nearly all the animals were visible and moving - not always a given from our experience. After the tram we walked round,m the 4 trails, again, not many people, and lots to see at our own pace. The Flying Fox was the highlight._x000D_
Only thing we missed, being midweek, there was no 1030 show (only Friday and Saturday)._x000D_

You get a taste of little bit of wilderness and its difficult to believe that you are smack in centre of a bustling city. There are shows all day round, its recommended that you pick and choose which one you want to see and plan accordingly. There is tram to roam around in the park. Tram is more like a fun ride rather than a means to move around in the park since the area of park is not too large to walk. Tram ride is recommended and our ticket that we got from Klook.com included the tram ride. Bird show at 'Pools Amphitheatre' is must see, plan your activity around this. We could also see 'Horn bill' show which was very informative and the lady giving the information was too good. Reserve at least 4-5 hours for this attraction but you can easily spend a day here if you have time.

It was inconceivable to imagine so many soldiers cramped together in the dank, poorly ventilated accommodation.

You can spend your whole day easily without noticing! You can see a lot of animals in a very authentic environment! There are also free roaming animals on the trees some even come close to you! Try to plan you route and have a map! It is very easy to miss the places because the animals are not next to the main road but on small trails and the direction boards are not very informative if there are any.

Sir Mariamman Temple, dedicated to the goddess who cures illnesses and diseases, was built by India immigrants. The first thing you will notice is the light colored boundary wall with sacred cows laying on top of the wall as well as the brightly painted domes and statues. The tall tower covered with sculptures of deities, mythological beasts, and other beings caught my eye. It was fascinating to look at the intricacy of these sculptures. Two wooden doors covered with bells mark the entrance. Worshippers ring these bells for good luck or to be sure the gods answer their prayers. Shoes must be removed before entering. Throughout the temple, there is much decorative detailing throughout. There are a series of small altars where you would find people worshipping. I walked into an area where many Hindus were in a serving line receiving platters of food. I realized this was also a social gathering place for worshippers and their families.

The concept is brilliant, the atmosphere at night is amazing but getting to see the animals,, i.e. the reason one goes to a zoo, was pretty weak._x000D_
The tram ride was horrible. You get schooled over and over about the importance of not using flash photography, both for the animals and fellow visitorsâ€™ experience, and to not make any noises that might startle the animals. We get on the tram and get blinded right away as the staff are going around taking flash photos of you sitting there so they can get more money out of your pocket. Then the tram we were on squealed like a banshee every time our non-attentive driver hit the brakes. You could not hear yourself think as the noise of the brakes was so loud. Additionally, if our driver had of spent 25% as much time focusing on his job of driving instead of flirting with the female staff member he would have been more effective at slowing down so we could actually see a few of the animals that were out.

563112177,2018-02-27 00:00:00.000,4,Beautiful cloud forest and flower dome... a bit expensive though...,"Singapore is this interesting place that can be quite appealing to some people and boring to others. In our case, we are undecided if we belong to the second group or to a group in the middle. Nevertheless, keep this in mind whilst reading my review._x000D_
_x000D_
Now... I need to give you a second warning. My reviews tend to be a tad long, so I am going to give you a way out a very short version of the review:_x000D_
_x000D_
The Gardens have a lot of things: parks (quite pretty, well worth walking most of it even though the heat might challenge your mood), the supertree grove (weird concrete trees) host lots of plants but in reality are super smart/advance cooling towers for a power plant, finally you have the domes, both of them are interesting on their own; one has waterfalls and a sort of rainforest and the other one a huge amount of flowers (lots of orchids as well and plants from South America). Each dome has a price to get in and there are combined tickets making visiting the gardens a tad cheaper. That's the short review... next, a pretty long one. You can stop reading if you got enough information._x000D_
_x000D_
I see... you continued reading regardless of the warning at the top... so begin by saying:_x000D_
_x000D_
Gardens by the Bay is a lot more than the cloud forest and the flower dome. It is a pretty big area covering parks, the power plant (or those weird tree shapes called Supertree groves) fueled by plant material that gets burnt, captured and returned to the environment, the two massive domes (glasshouses), a river (sort of) that goes through it from which you will get gorgeous photos of the Marina Bay Sands and flowers._x000D_
_x000D_
The Supertree Grove has a restaurant and a series of bridges connecting some of the trees (all of it has an entry fee) but it also has informative plates around telling you what is what and its functionality. I recommend you to look for it, is super cool for engineers, environmentalists and might be good for kids as well. In general, the info panels explain that Singapore can generate a lot of biomass that can be burnt to generate power... making this activity carbon neutral as you would be using the dead matter that captured carbon initially. Some of the newly produced CO2 is pumped into the domes to promote the growth of the forest, capture some of the moisture from the air before releasing it once more to the environment. Going back to the restaurant, the view from up there might be amazing, we did not go there as we had spent quite some money before coming here and wanted to reduce some of the expenses. Though, if you have $12 you might be able to go up and visit the skywalk (a series of bridges between the supertrees). Again, we did not go up the skywalk, mainly because my missus is afraid of heights, which is irrational as the bridges look pretty solid to me. In any case, I think a visit to the supertrees can be quite interesting and can be economical as there is plenty to see without paying the tickets to these attractions I have described above._x000D_
_x000D_
From the Supertrees, you could go towards the domes OR you can go towards the heritage gardens and the dragonfly (and something) river/lakes. We decided to walk towards these other gardens before going to the domes (as we thought it was going to be easier to go to public transport from the domes... this is not the case, so I will recommend you to visit the domes FIRST, AND come back to these other ones as the gardens are beautiful. Lots of statues and art disseminated around giving you the impression of being in one of the stories of Alice in Wonderland (even when you find the gigantic metallic dragonflies on the lake). Walking around these parts is super easy although it can be confusing as the winding path and the multiple construction sites (expanding the parks?) can leave you disorientated for a bit.

The driver of the tram, (Livanesh) was speeding throughout the whole trip. I was starting to feel uncomfortable about it as we could smell a burnt clutch smell all the way, always jam emergency break whenever he stopped at attraction points, and what made it worse was towards the end as we were along the stretch of road approaching the stop, in order to avoid collision with a parked tram on the side, he swerved the steering wheel abruptly at a fast speed and there happened to be a hump which caused the last two carriages of the tram to sway left and right tremendously as the wheels were lifted from the ground. I am utterly disappointed by how the driver drove as I nearly fell out from the tram if not for my friend holding on to me. Even though there were not many passengers, this is not the right way to drive as there were still kids and a woman carrying a toddler onboard. Such a dangerous act should be condemned. I hope the management will take this very seriously and not wait till passengers really fall out from the tram.

As well as being educational, the floral displays are beautiful and the cloud walk through the mist is essential.

Apparently you can get to a particular bar at the top, or as we did, take the level 3 lift to the large cantilevered open deck area. It seems you canâ€™t go from the open deck to the bar area without going back down and buying a separate ticket. (Seems a bit silly). We didnâ€™t pre-purchase tickets on-line â€“ just turned up during a weekday, when there were fewer people. The views are truly amazing. Because we lingered here for a long while to take it all in (and to take lots of photos) weâ€™re glad we chose to do this instead of the Flyer. Be aware that the area is completely open ie there is no shelter from rain or the intense sun. No seating either. Were it not for being corralled into a seemingly obligatory photo shoot at the level 3 lift, then being pounced upon to buy a particularly expensive photo pack when alighting from the lift at the top (polite staff simply doing their job), we would have given this attraction an â€œExcellentâ€ rating.",2017-03-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-29 13:51:39.526,Neil_and_Vicki_2013,Australia,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,Leisure & Recreation,"10 Bayfront Avenue | Level 57, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Singapore 018956, Singapore",0.0,0.723,0.277,0.3182,0.034,0.875,0.091,0.8834

Love it being pitch black out with the light spotlighted on where each animal exhibit is. Has a spooky aura to it. A great variety of animals can be seen on your left and right. The only downside if it can be a downside is no pics can be taken due to the tram always moving and it being so dark out. I understand the flash can't be used to trigger the animals. It's something you gotta take in and enjoy and put your phone/camera away. Tram ride is about 15-20 minutes I'll say. Plenty of places to eat and gift shops to enjoy.

The safari consists of four walking trails and one tram ride. They are all mostly separate - what you see from the tram ride, you won't be able to see from the trails._x000D_
_x000D_
Tips:_x000D_
_x000D_
1. There is a fire show before you enter the venue, but given the huge crowds, you probably won't be able to see it. If you've seen a Polynesian fire show in Hawaii, it's pretty much the same._x000D_
_x000D_
2. Arrive 30-45 minutes before your admission showtime, to get a front seat at the ""Creatures of the Night"" show. The show is aimed at kids, and good but not amazing. We saw bear cats, otters, owls, a serval cat, and a huge snake._x000D_
_x000D_
3. Take the walking trails first, THEN do the tram ride at the end, when it's far less crowded, and you'll be tired from walking._x000D_

My wife and I chose to head right away to join the queue for the ""Creatures of the Night"" Show upon entering the park. We were rewarded with good seats in the middle section (free seating on first-come-first-served basis) and were treated to an entertaining show that featured various noctural animals... there was also the staged commotion in the audience arena... (Oops! Too much said...visit and see for yourselves!)._x000D_
_x000D_
After the show, we have the option to take a walk through the various trails/tracks or the night tram. We chose the latter for compliemntary guided tram ride, complete with audio commentary in English on the various noctural animals. Fortunately for us, the queue moved pretty quickly (we were told by friends later that we could pay S$10 for express boarding, i.e. queue cutting)._x000D_
_x000D_
The tram ride was comfortable and gave ample chance to spot the night creatures. It was great viewing the animals from a comfortable distance although we could have taken a walk through the well-planned trails/tracks and spend more time with the night creatures but we didn't have time that evening._x000D_

The Zoo has quite widely separated animal displays, usually separated by a mixture of planted and more original tropical forest. The displays are very varied, providing environments that are suited to their inhabitants. Highlights include the white tigers, one of whom at least didn't appear too happy to be in captivity, the polar bear, where you could view the large pond through glass walls to get a great view of the bear swimming, and the various apes and monkeys swinging through the ropes and branches. The elephant enclosure was surrounded on one quarter by stands from which to view regular exhibitions._x000D_
_x000D_
The grounds are very well serviced by toilets, drink outlets and restaurants, and all the paths are pram friendly. Road trains can be used around the site if you get sick of walking. The shops on the site have lots of cuddly soft animal toys-- avoid them if you want to limit the kids cost!_x000D_

At the one-way bridge (the ""tree top"" part), you will likely be greeted by several monkeys -- we had never seen that before, and it was truly amazing to see monkeys outside of a zoo environment. As for the walk, you need to be in SOME sort of reasonable shape, but it really isn't bad -- the shade provided by the forest canopy helps a lot. Overall, this was the highlight of our Singapore visit.

Perhaps the strongest element was the way the guide brought to life the narrative of the people who worked in the Battle Box, those affected by the Japanese invasion and the terrible dilemma with which Percival and Simmons wrestled.

The specimens of olive trees on display are centuries old, the largest I have ever seen -- and I have seen old olive trees in many Mediterranean countries. There are trees from Australia and Africa, all beautiful and in best health. After you tour the display, at all its various levels, you can watch a short enlightening documentary about the effects of global warming on the biosphere just before exiting the cupola. One cannot help wandering though if the Gardens by the Bay do not contribute to global warming themselves? They are such a huge climate-controlled space in the midst of hot and humid Singapore -- and that costs huge amounts of energy.

499284174,2017-07-07 00:00:00.000,5,Awesome! Must do.,"We had been to Singapore Zoo before and thought it was brilliant during the day time. But doing the Night Safari is even better for many reasons. Firstly, it's much cooler and no mosquitoes. Secondly, the animals are more active. We booked on line for first available time slot of 7:15pm (our kids are 6yo & 8 yo) so it wouldn't be too late a night. We caught a taxi early so we could eat there before hand. Suggest you go straight into the Creatures of the Night show first as the show is only every hour, so as more people come in later it is more difficult to get a seat. Being from Australia we decided to skip the Wallaby Trail, and walked through the Fishing Cat Trail and the Leopard Trail. You see a lot more walking these ones and the walk at night is really nice. We then caught the Tram from Station 3 as animals on East Lodge Trail are easier to see, plus you can't see Elephants, Rhinos, Wolf unless you go by tram. Whole thing was a really great experience. Easier to get a taxi to & from Clarke Quay than any other transport option. Only $30 each way. Only down side is that you MUST not use your flash on your camera in the park or it can harm the animals, so your photos end up pretty dark.

We intentionally chose this place to visit because it is almost entirely covered in shade, and extremely easy to navigate. There is just one route and you just follow that route, which will bring you to at least five themes of river e.g. Amazon River (America), Ganges River (India), Yangtze River (China), Mekong River (Vietnam), etc etc etc, The animal exhibits were were curated and well taken care of._x000D_
_x000D_
We even rented two scooters from the front counter, at about sgd20 per scooter for about two hours. The elderly in our family had a great time even though they couldn't walk much. And the little ones enjoyed being in the prams with no bumpy roads, just smooth rides all along. Great family bonding between the very young and old._x000D_
_x000D_
The first highlight was definitely the pandas conservatory, as we were able to literally walk into it, on a bridge hanging in the air above their home on the ground. Tip: they are most active at 9am, during breakfast time. Miss that golden timing and you may not be able to catch them at all!_x000D_
_x000D_
The second highlight were the River Safari boat rides. However, even though the family caught the ride at around 11am, most animals were already hiding and sleeping as it was hot out there. Tough luck. Probably better to come at a not-so-hot timing in Singapore (which is tough too considering Singapore is famous for being hot all year round). Well at least the ride itself was leisurely and enjoyable. Those who are not able to ride the boats (i.e. children below 1 metre) can actually enjoy meeting some animals at the mini stage set up right beside the river boat's ticketing booth. The little ones managed to feed some wombats and pelicans and that was awesome._x000D_
_x000D_
The third highlight, and possibly one of the coolest, was their Amazon River aquarium. How very cool to depict the flooded Amazonian Rivers with its seasonal aquatic animals entering and living in the forest, when it's flooded. You can view the manatees both from the aquarium point of view, as well as from above the aquarium. It's true that it's not a full aquarium like the SEAquarium at Sentosa, but hey, it's pretty good enough considering it's only ONE of the many other interesting spots within this River Safari._x000D_
_x000D_
There ain't many eateries, but several small ones which were good enough:_x000D_
- mama panda cafe right after the panda exhibit, great first point of rest for your tired feet with strong air-conditioning_x000D_
- several ""stores"" all housed in the big tent at the main entrance/exit to this park. They sell local foods, desserts, western and Italian foods, ice-cream, and of course Chinese foods too. No A/C here._x000D_

The show lasts about 30 minutes, and then you can walk towards the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and over a small bridge to the hotel.

The ""lory loft"" is a popular area, which allows an interaction with many lorikeets through feeding (small cups of sugar water can be purchased). The Jurong bird park is delightful and absoloutely one of the best aviary experiences I've ever had. I only had 4 hours in the park and wished I had longer, but I LOVE birds.

We got there early so we could do the first train tour because we have a young child. You take a train ride around the park which takes around 45 minutes then you're free to walk around yourself on the walking tracks. I'd recommend doing the walk as well as it's a nice walk and you can stop and observe the animals for as long as you like. We also were lucky enough to come across a couple of zoo keepers and enjoyed asking them lots of questions about the animals. We particularly enjoyed the otters and were offered some pallets from the zoo keeper to feed to them. My son thought this was the highlight as they're funny creatures and very noisy._x000D_
In regards to the trains - what we did notice however is when we saw later trains, around 8pm, there was hardly anyone on them. So if you have older children, or none at all, then I'd say come a little later to avoid the hordes of people and queues._x000D_
We took public transport to get out there which was simple and inexpensive however it will take around 1.5 hours to get there on the train & bus (from Marina Bay Sands). By taxi it takes 30 minutes and costs around $30._x000D_
I noted that another reviewer said a potential problem was that you were committed to the date and time when you bought the tickets. I found that to be true of most online providers except one. VOYAGIN. I bought my tickets on the day from an online reseller called VOYAGIN. The ticket didn't offer a hard date or time. We arrived early just in case we couldn't get into the first train ride but there was no problem at all. The tickets were valide for around 3 months I think and for any of the time slots. I recommend this company as their prices were competitive and as i said, offered a choice of day & time._x000D_
Oh, don't bother trying to take pictures, they generally won't work. The only ones that worked were of the flamingoes. I was using my iPhone._x000D_

The Good. As with all Singapore attractions it's very well packaged and polished. Good food selections, a good vibe and neat and tidy. There's enough to do to keep you interested for an hour or two. You will (may) see some animals within 4 - 5 metres or so. Staff, for the most part, are friendly and helpful._x000D_

The Bad. It's dark. Ok so there are special lights that allow you to see... well kind of... but it's not like seeing animals during sunlight hours at your own pace. Just about every animal on the tour you can see just fine in most other zoos during the day. As with all Tourist traps like this, you are simply a number hearded like cattle through the attractions... and exit past the gift shops. The tram whizzes by every enclosure so that only a glimpse is possible and thus no real time to have a good look._x000D_

It's worth mentioning that the zoo is about 30min in a charter bus or taxi from the city area._x000D_

We saw one male lion and some Elephants at close range, but many others were elusive. You may see some deer, a bear or two, a peek at a tiger, some cattle, hyenas, rhinos, flamingos and the seemingly obligatory zebra / giraffe enclosure. It's rushed, rather dull and... err... dark._x000D_

I've read about Sungei Buloh Wetland reserve and asked around how to get there. I was advised it's pretty complicated to get there but it's worth it. It was actually quite easy but it took about an hour to get there from the city center. I used the subway til Kranji station and from there I took a taxi because I didn't want to loose much time waiting for the bus. Coming back I used the bus+subway -so there are public transportation options. Once you get there you can follow several trails with plenty of birdlife: storks, herons&egrets, waders, orioles and a few passerines. I got there at low tide and got to see a huge estuarine crocodile, plenty of mudskippers and lizards but missed the horseshoe crabs. The cicadas were unbelievably loud but very enjoyable!_x000D_
The trails have info panels along them and are nicely marked and even if you are not a passionate birdwatcher you can still enjoy a nice walk in the nature.

Itâ€™s the Bayfront stop on the yellow MRT line. There is an elevated walkway from the Sands hotel that takes you right to the Supertrees. (See photo) The Supertrees are 25-50 meters tall, and one of the trees is as high as a 16 story building. The tops of some of the trees contain photovoltaic cells, which collect energy from the sun. The Supertrees are actually vertical gardens, with climbing plants from all over the world growing up the sides. There are diagrams and information on how the trees collect, store and distribute energy and some act as air exhausts. (See photo) Visiting the gardens and the Supertrees from the ground is free._x000D_
_x000D_
There is also an ariel walkway 22 meters off the ground (OCBC Skyway) which winds around between several of the trees. (See photos) The cost to access the Skyway is 8 Singapore dollars per adult. We went during the day, and it was not crowded. But there was a queue line set up, so I imagine it gets very crowded at night when the Supertrees are all lit up._x000D_

If you can itâ€™s worth getting priority boarding for the tram ride as it lets you skip the queues which can be very long. The tram does not stop so you donâ€™t have the opportunity to stop and observe those animals and the continual movement makes any photography in dark conditions impractical. Having said that there is a fair chance of seeing some great animals like tapir fairly close up. Just ditch the camera for this part. More interesting are the paths where you can take your time and watch the animals. The high point for me was going into a large enclosure and seeing fruit bats just inches away - with no glass or barrier - eating and active. If you want to observe the animals at leisure the paths are less crowded and much more interesting than the â€œsafariâ€ ride.,2019-06-01 00:00:00.000,Friends,2020-01-30 15:48:48.453,Uktraveller492,United Kingdom,Night Safari,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",0.0,0.619,0.381,0.2144,0.02,0.806,0.174,0.9763

My partner and I decided to take a tour of the historical Singapore Battlebox during our stay in the city November 2016. Whilst we were aware of the major points of Singapore history whilst under British Governance the Battlebox tour focuses on the fall of the city during World War 2._x000D_
_x000D_
With this in mind, I'd break my review up into two distinct parts; the Battlebox fortification itself and the company behind the tour Singapore History Consultants._x000D_
_x000D_
Firstly on the fort itself, this tour doesn't take you to a building that's survived the test of time expecting it to tell you a story on its own. The Battlebox doesn't do this as it has been preserved and repaired to such a state that modern day visitors can freely visit. To enchance this, each room with historical significance has been fleshed out with mannequins and furniture so that it's relevance will be understood when encountered. Small details like British and Japanese graffiti have been preserved too._x000D_
_x000D_
Moving onto the Tour Operators, I can only offer the highest praise to both the shop staff and the tour guide provided by Singapore History Consultants. The shop staff were welcoming and full of suggestions on things to do during our stay. Jerome our guide for the morning was a perfect dichotomy of manners, knowledge and charm. His sphere of knowledge wasn't just limited to the Singapore campaign but expanded to the entire Japanese theatre of war across the Pacific region. For those that might be doing their family research or know military participation in this part of the world, you'll gain a little bit more value._x000D_

372319926,2016-05-12 00:00:00.000,5,A wonderous world of botany within the city,"Many people have already shared their experience of Gardens by the Bay (which I'll refer to as ""Gardens"" for the remainder of this review), so I'll add my perspective and tips from a photographer's point of view._x000D_
_x000D_
There are 3 main places worth visiting, starting with the Flower Dome, moving on to the Cloud Forest, then the tram ride which takes you to other parts of the Gardens._x000D_
_x000D_
The Flower Dome is massive, and the first thing I noticed was a lack of internal pillars - great for photography, since there was nothing to get in the way of a good shot. On entering, you'll find yourself best set up with a wide angle lens (I used a Leica Tri-Elmar shot at 16mm) to capture the inside of the dome._x000D_
_x000D_
Once inside, depending on the attractions on display, you'll enjoy a wide variety of flora - the main attraction when I visit was the Tulip Display, but I was told that a couple of months before, there were Cherry Blossoms!_x000D_
_x000D_
At this point in time, I didn't find a wide angle much use and switched to a macro lens for close-up photography. The images below were shot with the Leica 90mm f4 Elmar with the Macro-M Adapter with the EVF attached to a Leica M240. You're probably much better off with something like the Olympus OM-D E-M5 or similar with the 60mm f2.8 macro lens with good image stabilization and autofocus!_x000D_
_x000D_
I spent a good 90 minutes in the Flower Dome itself, and given the cool and dry air within the Dome, I could have spent 2 to 3 times that amount of time shooting flowers alone (and I know some people who do!). Try to do in the early morning when the light is muted and it's far less crowded. Watch out for tourists with selfie sticks once the crowd hits - many of them don't look where they go and are likely to bump into your tripod._x000D_
_x000D_
On the topic of tripods, I really wouldn't advise bringing a standard sized tripod, due to the fact that many of the flowers are quite low to the ground, and aforementioned tourists are likely to trip over the legs or bump into it. Instead, in the day, you'll do well with handheld shots._x000D_
_x000D_
Moving on to the Cloud Forest, which is the next dome, just 30 m away from the exit of the Flower Dome, watch out for the waterfall that greets you on entry. The spray from the waterfall is quite pronounced, so do mind not getting your lens and camera wet. I shot the waterfall with a 16mm lens at 1/15s shutter speed, which should give you an idea of what it would take to capture the scene in 1 shot. I noticed a couple of tourists with Nikon's 14-24mm lens, though the wonderful and practical 16-35mm would have done equally well. Moving on, the Forest offers mesmerizing wide angle views of the interior as well as close-up shots of the multitude of flora on display, so you'll be challenged to decide which lens to use!_x000D_
_x000D_
Watch for the Lego display - I won't ruin the surprise, but it's unlikely that you'll miss it, having to pass it when you take the elevator to the top of the Forest._x000D_
_x000D_
From the top, the view is rather pretty. Again, a wide angle lens is brilliant for the job, though you might want to keep the macro lens on standby since there are other interesting plants and flowers on the way down, along with a display area with stalactites and stalagmites._x000D_
_x000D_
Take the time to look down from the winding platform from time to time as there are interesting photo opportunities along the way._x000D_
_x000D_
Other than that, I didn't find much else to photograph until we got to the Visitor Center where we boarded a tram that took us to other parts of the Gardens. I strongly recommend sitting on the LEFT side of the tram since you will pass areas which offer a beautiful view of the Supertrees and the Singapore skyline, among other photo opportunities._x000D_
_x000D_
The tram ride takes around 20 minutes to complete, and you can make a mental note of which parts of the 'outside' Gardens you want to re-visit for other shots which couldn't have been shot from the tram.

I was on a basic ticket in the Bay Grandstand. The view wasnâ€™t very good. I felt like I was watching a tennis match. Instead of following the ball from right to left it was the cars passing by. Also, as this is a street track the track is surrounded by high fencing and the track is even lower down so cars following the racing line maybe obscured even further. I appreciate this is for safety but it doesnâ€™t really help for the viewing experience. I did go to the free viewing points at times and you could see the cars and drivers a bit closer but the view is nothing special. These points are better for the driverâ€™s parade though._x000D_

In fact most of the time that was all I was doing watching the screens opposite the track!_x000D_

The zone 3 and 4 my ticket allowed had some good restaurants and bars and there were a few concerts over the three days. As expected souvenirs and programme were quite expensive but you see that at every sporting event. I found the security and staff a mixed bunch. Some were friendly and helpful others just seemed they wanted you to leave the place as soon as the various sessions were over. A bit annoying when I wanted to buy a shirt from a shop after._x000D_

Only a true blooded naturalist or those scientifically inclined, would enjoy a few hours in this museum._x000D_
The star of the museum is the 3 dinosaur skeletons that the museum had purchased. Though magnificent, I failed to see the relevance of the dinosaur bones to this museum as huge dinosaurs like these were probably not in this region during the age of the dinosaurs._x000D_
Lots of the exhibits were also from the collections from the National Museum of Singapore, especially the collections of the early British administrators of the colony of Singapore._x000D_

We took a cab to the reservoir and stocked up on drinks and something to eat before setting off on the 11km trail. Half way round would be the tree top walk which we were told was a must. Unfortunately, as it turned out, can honestly say it wasnÂ´t. Massively over rated. Queues were rather long to go across the bridge as they only allow 30 on at a time, so if there is a relatively long line dont bother. Its up high but doesnÂ´t really add much. The monkeys that are around are far more entertaining as they search for food, some being rather bold and actually taking things from peoples back packs._x000D_

There are a few shows to watch - we managed to watch all the shows except Animal Friends Show. All the shows need volunteers, so don't be shy and raise your hands._x000D_
Before going, check their website and take note of the animal feeding times - there is the normal feeding time where the zookepers feed the animals and we watch, and the more exciting event is token feeding where visitors pay SGD5 for a basket of food to feed the animals. This is usually limited to a certain number of visitor families to control the animals' diet, so make sure you're there well before the appointed time. The animals are well kept and are allowed to roam relatively freely in partial enclosures, so you get to see them in a comfortable environment for them. One exhibit we should mention is the Fragile Forest - you may be tempted to skip this as it's a bit off the main road, but don't!

My wife and I recently celebrated our 10th anniversary and started in Singapore for two weeks throughout SE Asia. We booked several activities along the way, and picked several impromptu things while in country. The Singapore Zoo was a last minute pick, and we loved every minute of our visit._x000D_
_x000D_
Compared to most zoos in the US, this zoo uses natural barriers. You'll find minimal ""caging"" and often it feel like you can reach out and touch them....and in some cases you can as part of a zoo feeding. Beautiful variety of animals here, many that you'll find unique to the region. We debated the night zoo, and after reading several other reviews opted not to partake. A Sunday visit around mid afternoon was not chaotic as one would expect. We did pay for the tram use, a great way to see the overall grounds and general planning of what to expect / visit._x000D_
_x000D_
Without a doubt our favorite experience was seeing Inuka the polar bear. This gentle giant is 27 years old, and you can see and hear the compassion his caretakers have. We went to an afternoon performance where upfront you're advised he will only perform if he chooses to. We love this. No pressure on the animal to ""perform,"" they'll interact at their leisure. Ten minutes after the opening statement by Inuka's caretaker and he appeared more sleepy vs. playful. As the caretaker explained he's an older bear and he likely would continue to rest, this beautiful animal came to life and dove into the pool. He lives at his pace, his way: snow cave, pool, the waterfall or sun deck. It's obvious he's loved and well taken care of, just as every other animal is here._x000D_
_x000D_
There are several moments you forget this is a zoo. It's feels very natural, comfortable for animals and visitors alike. Plenty of food and drink options, there is something here for everyone. As a 37 and 32 y/o couple, we loved our visit. Inuka will hold a special place in our memories, and this was a great impromptu experience while in Singapore.",2018-02-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-26 12:38:50.991,goose3nbc,United States,Singapore Zoo,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",0.0,0.64,0.36,0.6696,0.025,0.795,0.18,0.9964

WOW WOW WOW! the flower dome sounds like something your nana would want to go and see but it is amazing! (and also nice and cool and a nice relief from the heat outside!) these domes are way huger than I expected and absolutely breath taking.. they take you on a journey through different types of plants from cacti to stunning rainforests and then amazing cherry blossoms where you would swear you were in japan! then just when you think it cant get any more amazing - you enter the rainforest dome. the waterfall and MASSIVE vertical gardens will blow your mind! the walking paths along the way take you up in, around, behind and in front of the giant waterfall. the mist makes it look even more special and there are some surprises along the way too ( I don't want to spoil it for you! )_x000D_

It is a beautiful temple, both the exterior and the interior which has many statues and sculptures. Removal of footwear is required before entering and modest dress ( covering of shoulders and no shorts) necessary. The interior has partitioning to prevent tourists from entering sacred areas but there is still much to see. I appreciated the serenity and got some lovely photos. As someone who has never visited a Hindu temple before I appreciated being able to visit and to have a glimpse into the Hindu culture.

If you have limited time at the Gardens by the Bay, go to the Cloud Forest dome first.

Many of the sales items also seem to be items which can't sell. If you would like to experience a more 'local' shopping experience (though you might not buy anything there), try places like Toa Payoh, Little India and Kampong Glam.

I set aside about 4 hours to look at the art as well as the architecture, as well as having a coffee at the end, and I was left impressed and wanting for more._x000D_
_x000D_
I would recommend you to visit this place at 10am when it opens so that you can view the art in relative peace and quiet. Start from the ""City Hall"" side where you can view the historic Singapore art and work your way up from the 1st floor. Cross the bridge at the top floor, and make your way down the ""Supreme Court"" side, viewing the rotunda as you go. The ""Supreme Court"" part has more gallery exhibitions which are mostly from South-east Asia. There are a few pieces there which are truly stunning._x000D_
_x000D_
The National Gallery also has an app which you can download prior to going so you can plan your visit. I think it's fun but it's not necessary. Sometimes the best thing about viewing art is coming round the corner and seeing a beautiful piece which captures your eye._x000D_

There is a expansive children's section on the Ground floor which is very impressive. Plenty of top-notch cafes and restaurants let you have breaks throughout your visit. Get a coffee from the cafes on the Ground floor (near the gift shops - I think they are called Vanilla Bakery Cafe - very good coffee).

Thereâ€™s a guided tour daily, at 11am which concentrates on the history of the building. Places are limited to 20, and photo ID is required (I think this is to ensure visitors do not walk off with the headsets). The tour should last an hour, but it actually took 90 minutes. The volunteer guide had worked in the court as an usher which made the tour personal. Also another of our group had regularly visited the courtroom in his lunch hour to listen to the proceedings._x000D_
Judging by our group, about 50% were local, so this tour appeals to everybody._x000D_
We also loved the views of the city from Level 6._x000D_
Excellent toilets are available in several places on every floor. Disabled access is great, with lifts and ramps as necessary. There were plenty of places to sit, except when waiting for the guided tour to start, where seating was inadequate (5 seats for 20 people)._x000D_
Our only disappointment was lunch, bought from Gallery & Co on Level 1. The sandwiches were tasty, but I really expect a cafÃ© in that price range to serve them on a plate, perhaps with a side salad and not just wrapped in paper. We had to get the staff to cut them in half to make it practical to eat them. And it was the first place in Singapore which hasnâ€™t offered ice with soft drinks. Better food options are available outside the museum._x000D_
We didnâ€™t have time in the end to see the art galleries, that will have to wait for another visit.

The safari is actually open until 12:00am and if you are close or can afford a private transfer I would do that as slightly rushed to get round being tied to the bus. It also stopped everywhere going back and was an open aired bus which on the top deck was interesting / fun on a motorway._x000D_
_x000D_
Anyhow back to the Safari. It was amazing. Tip avoid the tram as big queues and you donâ€™t get close to the animals. Head straight for the show then the walking trails. The walking trials are close to the animal enclosures and you really feel almost like you are in a Kenyan game park camp apart from you know the animals are in an enclosed zone. The animals are alert and nocturnal ones active. We were lucky to tag behind a game keeper that was feeding so brilliant. Really enjoyed the bat walk through with swooping fruit bats around you. There were quite. Few places to eat but we didnâ€™t have time to stop there due to the bus._x000D_

360082477,2016-03-30 00:00:00.000,4,Well Done and Fun for All Ages - But Time for an Update,"This was my sixth trip to the Night Safari - going back almost a decade. I still love the novelty of going to a zoo at night - and seeing the animals in a different light (or lack thereof) compared to what you see during the day. That said - I think its time for the zoo to either expand a bit (particularly on the tram ride) - or maybe refresh the exhibits so that there is more to look forward to on repeat trips. That said - I think that the park is basically being run as a novelty type attraction - grab the tourists once - and no need to focus on the repeat customers._x000D_
_x000D_
On this trip - we arrived around 8:45 p.m. - and the lines were very long and slow to take the tram ride. In terms of loading the trams - they were very inconsistent. Some of the staff allowed parties of two to have their own bench seat on the tram - while in our case (and many others) we were overloaded on our seat (thanks to some extra large guests on our seat) and our knees and shoulders were crammed in to make sure we all remained in the tram. When it's steamy and hot - you don't want to be in this position!_x000D_
_x000D_
The exhibits were great - although the Bengal tigers are looking very bored - and I suspect animal rights experts would say that they need more enrichment as the 15 minutes we were with the tigers all they did was pace back and forth in the same place in front of the glass window - which is far from normal behavior - even in a zoo environment. To make sure you see everything - including all aspects of what you see in the trolley - it is worth your time walking on the multiple paths. Not only do you see some great Asian animals you won't see in your home zoo - but you can get much closer to the animal enclosures on the tram path - and can notice much more of what's going on with the animals in the areas of the enclosures not visible on the tram._x000D_
_x000D_
As usual with all things Singapore - the park is clean, the staff were friendly, and while I think the cost is a bit high for the number of animals they are actually exhibiting, you are paying a premium for the night experience.

Would definitely recommended the guided tour with kids as it keeps the information crisp and focused for the little ones over 75-90 minutes.

Older kids can probably self guide but I always recommend using the knowledge that is available from people who have actually studied this stuff rather than guessing._x000D_

The tour is a walk through the various rooms of the underground bunker, 9 meters/3 storeys down, with artefacts, maps, recreations of the decision making moments and obviously the story of what unfolded so swiftly in the Battle of Singapore in 1942. I donâ€™t think it is wheelchair friendly, did not see any elevators._x000D_

Book tickets ahead as the BattleBox is small and underground and they obviously keep group sizes small otherwise it would get loud._x000D_

Tour guide was no nonsense, military style, kept the kids in check. They will ask noisy or uncontrolled children to leave as it is a bunker and the sound echoes. Note the dad with toddler who was asked to step out of the room several times and missed a lot of the commentary. Put a bit of a downer on the morning and made me as a parent a little more anxious of my kidsâ€™ behaviour._x000D_

What didn't come over from other reviews is - the team runs every 5 to 10 minutes, not only at the entrance times advertised; those appear to be more about controlling the number of people in the park._x000D_

The tram trip is well done - the animals clearly get fed to keep them at the front of their pens. The commentary is informative but not obtrusive. It does go for about 40 mins and is a great way to get your bearings._x000D_

There are places to refill, but particularly the walk back from the bridge can be very long without water. Also, we encountered a monkey on the bridge, who stalked past us and hired menacingly at my daughter, when she studied him too closely. (There really was nowhere for her to go, they were both â€œtrappedâ€ on the bridge). She escaped with nothing more than a bit of a scare, but it would probably not have happened if she had taken the sign to â€œNot stare at the monkeysâ€ more seriously.

The best thing I recommend to do is walk to the feeding as by the time you get on the tram youâ€™ll probably miss it. So get there nice and early and go to the feedings and thereâ€™s also other shows on that we missed as they were all booked out by the time you got on the tram and back again._x000D_

The Merlion Park is one than a sculpture of the Merlion which in itself is magnificent and iconic. Take the time to enjoy the surrounding views as well especially Marina Bay and Marina Bay Sands right across. These views are especially breath taking at night with the Merlion elegantly lighted up. Think about this, just a little over 4 decades ago, when the Merlion was erected, there was no Marina Bay as it exists today, no tall skyscrapers behind, where Marina Bay Sands now stand was just reclaimed land. The Merlion would be proud of the progress it sees over time which is now made available for all to enjoy._x000D_

This lotus inspired, ingeniously named 'ArtScience Museum' is_x000D_
privately owned by the Marina Bay Sands Group, who own the casino and hotel of the same name._x000D_
Feng Shui is said to play an important hand in the design here and it literally does! Surely you can visualise the shape of a palm seemingly grasping or trying to contain something. Probably the hefty 19sgd entrance fees, LOL._x000D_
The ArtScience Museum is far from being a proper museum per say, as are the Singapore National Museum, Art Museum and Science Centre, which are the real deal. Yes, there are often free exhibitions in collaboration with who's who, that are worthy of a visit here if you so happen to be in the neighbourhood. This is just one section perhaps dedicated to the subject of Arts and Science which is free. This in turn tempts one into imagining what's to see in the paid section of the ArtScience Museum. Many assume there should be more of the same, only better. Yet it is the actual ArtScience Museum that one gets dissapointed with and anyone who reads the grouses on on TripAdvisor should know if this is really their scene._x000D_
Do not expect the ArtScience Museum to be at all like Singapore's mainstream museum. This is pretty much a OTT children's amusement centre in technicolor. Albeit, a fusion one at best. Not at all recommended for anyone above fourteen years of age._x000D_
The only adults you will find inside the ArtScience Museum is likely to fall into one of the categories below. They would be :_x000D_
1. Tourist's who believed it was Museum of Art & Science. (They would be the unhappy in expressing their views here)_x000D_
2. Extroverts on social media chasing the selfies and instagram likes. ( Because it might be raining outside or they have nothing currently worthy to post)_x000D_
3. Parents/Grandparents (myself included) who accompany the young children. (They will be looking for the true art and science section of this museum only to find none)_x000D_
It is claimed the future is created here at the ArtScience Museum, but all I felt the entire time, was like I was walking thru a long psychedelic kaleidoscope. In all fairness thou, my fourteen month old grandson enjoyed himself here immensely attracted by all the movements and colors._x000D_
Entertainment for some perhaps, but certainly not Science and if at all it is deemed as Art, it is Art without much content._x000D_
Go if a myriad of moving projected images of luminous technicolor on the floor, walls, ceilings and slides is your kinda playground. Yes, that's right, there are two slides and I betcha this is the only museum with a indoor slide in the world._x000D_
Older children who enjoy illustration can have their works projected on the walls while there and that's about as arty as it gets. Activities for the children will keep them occupied in a low light environment for some time without parents ever having to worry about sun stroke._x000D_
Do remember to bring a camera for low light photography as no flash photography is allowed. One exits by walking thru a prism of blinding bright white LED lights set against mirrors. The grand finale of harsh lights to walk thru was a Christmas overload._x000D_

The zoo itself consists of many open enclosures where the animals are roaming freely. if you look up as you alk around you may well find monkeys following and watching you. If it is hot, bring plenty of water and there are free refill stands along the way. There are, of course, extra costs along the way. You have to pay for photographs taken by professionals at the orangutan feeding etc. They will take photos on your camera butdo a sloppy job by photographing into the sun, out of focus etc. Food is reasonably expensive which explains why we saw a lot of familie4s with packed lunches.

_x000D_
Made the first enquiry mid November to which I was given all the information and told 2-3 weeks time confirmation will be sent. I was excited so 2 weeks in to the enquiry I emailed, it was referred onwards and was told that it had not been 2-3 weeks as mentioned, our place was reserved. No payment details though_x000D_
So i waited._x000D_
A month later I emailed again_x000D_
I was already a little frustrated as I had tried organising everything before our holiday. Was informed that the 'rates' hadn't been confirmed / changes may have occurred... Next day I was given an email with the pricing, link to the site for general info. Request for deposit. Busy enjoying our last day in Phuket Thailand before we went on a trip into the national park I didn't respond._x000D_
_x000D_
During our holiday we have been away for a few days in the national park (5th-7th). No net. No phone. No hassles._x000D_
During this stay the safari emailed on the 6th titled FIRST FOLLOW UP. At this stage I should mention during my holiday I have an auto'out of office' email saying I am away. They wanted to hear from us within 48hours. So today I got an email titled GIVING UP BOOKING. We were told that 'due to the lack of confirmation' from our end... You're kidding me. We tried to organise this well and truly in advance. First come first served (their words). we were first come and... Left out to dry._x000D_
_x000D_
After two emails expressing my disappointment and intent to cancel, I then had to explain in another email that I had already written to them about if I wanted to continue or not with the booking._x000D_

Overall a pointless endeavour. Can't believe I considered spending $200 each at a place that can't even get their bookings and emailing customers right..._x000D_

The forest has a trail of walking, elevators, escalators, downward steps, and more walking. In total, about a two hour journey, if you stop and take pictures. You can see a variety of rain forest plant life. The vegetation grows artificially along a man-made mountain enclosed in a domb. I found it enjoyable past time, for a day trip into Singapore._x000D_

Our family was confused of what was to be expected, but got into line and onto to a open-air shuttle. Think Disneyland parking shuttle. From there, we drove slowly through animal enclosures taking pictures in the artificially made moonlight. It was hard getting shots to even be visible, but it was very cool to be so close to the animals. The ride lasted around 30 - 45 mins._x000D_

Crowds gather to visit the popular Merlion statue.

Then weâ€™ll pick a few exhibits to see and go see those, timing them to coincide with some feedings and a show if the kids want (sea lion show is the best)._x000D_
_x000D_
Feedings we love: hamadryas baboons (I could watch these all day); giraffes (blue tongues!!)_x000D_
_x000D_
Favourite exhibits: fragile forest (up close with a variety of birds and small animals like sloth and mouse deer); those baboons; cheetah (get nice and close thru the glass. It paces quite a bit so good for little ones who find it hard to spot still animals from afar); all the apes and monkeys._x000D_
_x000D_
Playground: this is why you need your swim stuff. We always cap our zoo visit with the water playground because you will surely be hot and sticky and thereâ€™s nothing like jumping in a pool of water to fix that. Slides and fountains galore. Let the kids loose and you can sit aside and veg for a bit. Or if your kids are little, itâ€™s nice to stand in the pool too. There was minders keeping an eye out but if you have an under 3 year old, youâ€™ll have to be more mindful cos the water is about knee high for an adult. We adore this playground and iâ€™d Keep at least an hour for this if you donâ€™t wanna deal with a lot of whinging about leaving._x000D_
_x000D_
Tip: the day zoo is a full day trip with kids. Donâ€™t plan to do all three parks or even two in one day. This way, you can go at a non stressful pace and spend as much time as you like staring at one animal._x000D_
Of the three zoo parks, this is the best one for little kids. (Night safari is crowded and small kids find it hard to spot the animals in the dark, river safari was underwhelming for me... plus, no water playground!!)_x000D_

Food: limited options and all crowded. We usually just do KFC at the playground. Pizza and ice cream at the entrance is also good. The restaurants inside are ok too if you really need a nice place to rest. Expect high prices and mediocre fare tho. Of course, you could just pack sandwiches and picnic somewhere._x000D_

Meal was forgettable and poor. Service abysmal and they could care less about the customer. Tables not set up as asked; they argued. Then they served â€œfamily styleâ€ dishes for each table (nice concept) but NOT ENOUGH PORTIONS ON THE PLATES FOR EACH PERSON!!! For instance, at our table of 8 people, they served a basket with 4 rolls only and a chicken dish with only 6 pieces!!! When we complained, they only brought more portions for some of the food AND THEN CHARGED US EXTRA ON THE BILL. So we paid extra just to have one portion per person, when they knew exactly how many people we were going to be. The waiters and waitresses were totally disinterested during the meal and the manager at the end totally unapologetic. You could see that customer satisfaction was the LAST thing on his mind._x000D_

I've been there a few times and i realize that the staffs at the gardens are getting more rude and unprofessional. For example when I was buying the tickets for the indoor domes, this staff that served me was just talking to his friend beside on what to eat for dinner. Most of the staffs there kept using their phones as well when they are supposed attend to customers. The food there are just so so, it will be better to go to other hawkers or restaurant to eat. The indochine restaurant located around the supertree grove is good though. They serve decent food and drinks over there and when you go up you get to view the spectacular view of the ferris wheel and MBS at night! :)",2016-01-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-25 16:20:08.743,Miko C,Singapore,Gardens by the Bay,Leisure & Recreation,"18 Marina Gardens Drive | Bayfront Plaza, Singapore 018953, Singapore",0.0,0.614,0.386,0.8201,0.038,0.85,0.112,0.9049

Pedestrian crossings underpasses and bridges make the journey from hotels in the CBD far from direct and the heat makes it tempting to weave your way via the many shopping centres with air conditioning. Then you have to cross under a major highway._x000D_

The flyer is billed as the largest Ferris wheel and it is certainly impressive against the skyline. Early afternoon was quiet with no queue and we didn't feel the need to linger in the dingy exhibits lining the approach. The capsules were only half full so plenty of space to move around and enjoy the view. Strangely the places shown on ribbon posters inside the capsules were not aligned with where that building or landmark might be found but did give you a reminder of what you should be looking for._x000D_
_x000D_
Singapore's cityscape is best viewed from above and the Flyer gives ample time to do so. Even the Zeppelin like structure forming the top of the Bay Sands Hotel reveals some of its detail from the Flyer. Well worth the visit and time spent there though be aware that the commentary (limited) could be louder and clearer and the music that accompanies your rotation could be quieter!_x000D_
_x000D_
Allow time as you can't be sure how long the queue will be and ignore the rather soulless and frankly shabby shopping area at the base of the Flyer.

Macritchie is part of a much larger reservoir and catchment basin located in the middle of Singapore. They have carved out a 15 km round-trip trail that loops around the reservoir, and while it takes you through some really interesting jungle (I almost got run over by what I think was some kind of pig once), it also butts up against a pristine country club golf course._x000D_
_x000D_
The trail is great exercise, but you should be warned: if you are not used to physical exertion in this climate then you should take it slow. The trail is not a tough trail, but the thick jungle foliage traps the heat and humidity and it will suck the moisture out of you quickly so bring at least a 1.5 litre water bottle. The Tree Top Walk is of course gorgeous, but the walkway is also really narrow so you can easily get trapped behind a group of photo-snapping looky-loos for long stretches of time._x000D_
_x000D_
Also, a word to the wise - keep on eye on the sky. There are shelters spaced about every 1-2 km, but in Singapore the rain can come quick and hard at the drop of a hat. I've been caught in torrential downpours that flooded the trail. It's actually quite fun to get splashed by the rain while walking around a rain forest, but it also short circuited by iPhone so I'm not sure if it was worth it or not.",2017-05-01 00:00:00.000,Solo,2020-01-29 23:49:22.064,JamesGuild,United States,MacRitchie Nature Trail,Nature & Wildlife,"MacRitchie Reservoir Park, Singapore 298717, Singapore",0.0,0.635,0.365,0.5574,0.062,0.832,0.106,0.9193

_x000D_
Pros:_x000D_
1) animals you won't be able to see in a city like Singapore_x000D_
2) the animals in glass enclosures were better as you can see them up close_x000D_
3) was able to see the animal show about monkeys/apes & snakes - the highlight for me was the snake handler walked around for audience to touch the snake: i was able to pet the snake for 2 seconds which i never had the chance to do in my life - that was very interesting!_x000D_
_x000D_
Cons:_x000D_
1) It was raining on & off. The entire place though it has covered walkways was not all covered so we were wet: the management should think about upgrading the place since Singapore is always raining. They didn't have umbrellas for sale so we had to wait for 1 hour for the rain to stop_x000D_
_x000D_
2) Many of the animals were just sleeping or very far off so we couldn't see much. About 50% were like this. The design of the zoo was not good._x000D_
_x000D_
3) There aren't many signs so we won't able to tell where the next exhibits are. Very confusing. Bad map._x000D_
_x000D_
4a) VERY lacking in variety: if you see the map - a lot of animals are MONKEYS lol_x000D_
4b) Missing animals: camel, tiger, seal/walrus, horse, deer, different kinds of goats, buffaloes, wolves, foxes, bats, etc, etc. The big cat sections was also SO disappointing_x000D_
_x000D_
5) The dinosaur section got to be the lamest thing I have seen._x000D_
_x000D_
6) the snake / reptile sections is VERY lacking: there are so many snakes species out there lol!!_x000D_

_x000D_
We visited Gardens by the Bay as a family of 10 people, we went at approx 4pm. No queue for tickets to get into the two domes, and a relatively easy process. They recommend that you wait to by the sky walk passes once you are down there as they can close the skywalk dependant on weather conditions._x000D_
_x000D_
We opted for the flower dome first which had an orchid festival on. The orchids were amazing and so pretty and beautiful - patterns and colours that I have never seen before. This dome is split into gardens from all over the world and their native flowers and trees. After, we completed the cloud dome and again this was amazing. We were in the dome for the misting and that is fantastic for picture opportunities. The museum at the end of the cloud dome is eye opening - it describes all of the damage that we are doing to earth and the predictions that professionals are making - I highly recommend watching the short movie clip â€œ+5 degreesâ€_x000D_
_x000D_
Both domes took us around 3 hours but you could easily spend more or less time depending on how much time you want to spend in them. After the domes we headed to the skywalk also where the music and light show takes place._x000D_
_x000D_
Now in hindsight and what I would recommend doing is being down there as early as possible unless you want to do the skywalk in the evening. We done the skywalk around 730pm, which by this point it was dark. However the show begins at 745pm and they recommend that you are down underneath the trees lying down to look up and watch the show under the â€˜starsâ€™. We started queuing for the skywalk at around 630 so we waited in the queue for approx 1hour, completed the skywalk and were back down for the show to begin. The recommended time up in the skywalk is only 15mins and you have stewards that move you along if you are spending too much time up there._x000D_
_x000D_
The show itself is amazing, especially when you know that the entire gardens/domes/show is self sufficient and runs on solar power and collected water (for misting).

I have been here twice on this visit, but although as a South Asian I like to stroll along Serangoon Road, and browse in the shops selling clothes, bangles, incense, music, some handicrafts and jewelry, and offer a variety of Indian food, it still feels short of much that could add value to its name._x000D_
_x000D_
Given that the majority of the Indian community in Singapore hails from the south of India, one wishes to come across glimpses of the huge diversity of that country, and a bit of representation from at least a few of its many states. This is sorely missing from Little India. There's gold jewelry galore, and many shops that sell heavy, bridal gold jewelry. One wants to see many more saree shops, many more handicrafts from India's different regions, music in various languages of that country, and more variety in the cuisines._x000D_

The large 'everything under one roof' kind of store called Mustafa is a complete clutter.

It was very well set up with different sections of plants from different parts of the world, but it all flowed in very smoothly, makes for a very pleasant stroll. The Cloud Forest was my favorite because it was cool in there. The waterfall made for an impressive entrance, and the flowers and plants were constantly sprayed with mist, so it does make you feel that you are up in the clouds. The only complaint I have is that the way out is not well marked. We entered onto the 3rd floor ( there is no 2nd floor ) and you exit on the first floor. But there are no stairs to exit, you have to use the elevator. Fortunately, there is someone manning the elevators, so you just have to let him or her know that you wish to go out instead of going up again. There are a total of 7 floors._x000D_

There are 4 time-slot to enter Night Safari such as 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm, but earlier time-slots were sold out soon on consecutive holidays. Thus, I could collect tickets for 9:15pm although I arrived at this zoo around 4:30pm._x000D_

As you would expect, it is a bit tourist attraction and so was incredibly busy but there are ways to manage this. Booking online in advance is important first, not just because of the small discount to price but to make sure you get the earliest slot at 7.15pm as they do sell out. The other option is to try and go on a weekday instead of a weekend if possible. We arrived on the day at around 5.45/6pm and had dinner there; the buffet looked incredibly busy, but the range of normal stalls offered a great range and we had a really tasty kung pao chicken where one portion was enough to share between two. By the time weâ€™d finished, we went towards to entrance around 6.50 by which time queues had already formed to get into the park. They started letting people in around 7pm, which meant that we missed the fire show but it was worth it to get in earlier and see the first animal show inside. Do this first as the stewards suggest when you enter, but ignore them when they try and funnel you onto the trams when you come out of the show. Everyone else will go this way, leaving the walking trails nearly empty for you to explore. That way, by the time you complete the walking trails in comparative peace, there will be absolutely no queue for the tram to finish the evening. We saw everything there was and we were finished by around 10/10.30 before we caught an uber back to our hotel, about a half hour drive back into the city.",2017-10-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-30 15:25:34.760,adamathompson,United Kingdom,Night Safari,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",0.0,0.403,0.597,0.8126,0.044,0.862,0.094,0.9498

River Safari is well laid out and informative with fish and wildlife grouped according to which major rivers of the world they are from. The Amazon River Quest (an extra 5SGD for adults and 3SGD for children) lasts around 10 minutes and is worth doing to see the majestic jaguar, whereas the River Safari Cruise (also an extra 5SGD for adults and 3SGD for children) that lasts for around 15 minutes was a bit dull and you do not get to see very much wildlife on it._x000D_

Singapore Zoo is one the best and largest Zoos in the world. They have changed and keep changing the Zoo a lot for last few years. For now - the main attraction of the Zoo is the Polar bear Inuka, white Tigers, the biggest population of orangutans in the world and newborn Giraffe. Apart from it, you can find a lot of other animals as lions, elephants, kangaroos, flamingos, otters, zebras, rhinoceros etc. Singapore Zoo is done very nicely - you don't see really cages, the animals are kept in environment as close to natural as possible. It's pretty hot during the day and you may be tired of walking, so it's a good idea to take a tram - it costs additional 5 SGD, but provide you audio guide and relaxing way of traveling inside the Zoo._x000D_
