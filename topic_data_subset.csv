95382,553312717,2018-01-12 00:00:00.000,5,Amazing! Kids LOVED it.,"We needed something to do on a rainy day with our 10, 7 and two 5 year olds and came to the Museum almost by chance. As luck would have it, is was a Friday and up to four children enter free with one paying adult. We therefore decided to visit both the Futureworlds and the National Treasures exhibit. The kids were totally entranced by the Futureworld exhibit. We spent over 2 hours in there and had to drag the kids away for lunch. The installations are very interactive and pitched at children 4-12. A lot of the exhibition involves colouring in drawings which the kids can then scan. The drawings then become part of the installation. The kids were fascinated by this and did dozens of drawings. The other installations are also very appealing to children. Each exhibit is one-time entry only, so after finishing Future World we went to the nearby Food Court at Marina Bay Sands for lunch (a few minutes walk). As luck would have it we returned just before 3pm when there was a free guided tour of the Natural Treasures exhibit. The guide was excellent and because it was ""Family Friday"" pitched the tour at the kids. It was very interesting and informative. The tour took about 45 minutes and then we spent a further 15 minutes looking at the exhibits. We may return another day to do the free ""Into the Wild Tour"". (Looked like it involved some sort of tablet device). We would definitely recommend the Museum for families with young children (especially on Family Friday).",2018-01-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-30 14:01:02.826,CastlecragCouple,Australia,ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,"Art, History & Culture","10 Bayfront Avenue Marina Bay Sands, Singapore 018956, Singapore",need something rainy day two year old come museum almost chance luck would friday four child enter free one pay adult therefore decide visit futureworlds national treasure exhibit kid totally entrance futureworld exhibit spent hour drag kid away lunch installation interactive pitch child lot exhibition involves colour drawing kid scan drawing become part installation kid fascinate dozen drawing installation also appeal child exhibit one time entry finish future world go nearby food court marina bay sand lunch minute walk luck would return pm free guide tour natural treasure exhibit guide excellent family friday pitch tour kid interest informative tour take minute spent minute look exhibit may return another day free wild tour look like involve sort tablet device would definitely recommend museum family young child especially family friday,Artwork Quality

23324,547246933,2017-12-15 00:00:00.000,4,An amazing experience. Some tips & tricks make it better though!,"As first time visitors to Singapore, Marina Bay Sands was on the top of our list to visit and experience. We headed off in a cab (which is easy and affordable to do in Singapore). We arrived having been given the tip to ask to go to CE LA VI restaurant (located within the Sky Park) instead of just entering the general Sky Park area._x000D_
As our taxi dropped us on the opposite side of the road, it was quite a challenge to actually head over to the Sky Park entrance (so I would specify to the taxi driver that you want to go to Sky Park, rather than just Marina Bay Sands as we said). We enquired at a general enquiry counter as we couldn't work out how to get over the road (it's a big road!) and also asked about making a booking at CE LA VI restaurant. If that is something you are interested in, I would recommend you book some time in advance! It is quite highly priced (to much for us) and it was booked out anyway. Amazingly we were offered an opportunity to ""squeeze in"" for the small additional charge of $500 SD. We declined that fantastic and generous offer and wandered over and paid the $20 admission to enter the general bar area of CE LA VI. The good thing about this charge is that you can redeem it on a drink from their bar. CE LA VI is set back from the edge of the Marina Bay Sands but you can still admire the amazing views of the Singapore skyline. If you walk around to the side of the building that looks out over Gardens on the Bay, you can get right up to the edge however and also get a glimpse of the infinity pool to your right. The bar area is very crowded and busy and we had to shuffle forward to finally get a position at the front where we could enjoy our $27SD drinks and take in the view. There is smoking in this area which was a little annoying as we had our 17 year old daughter with us, plus lots of full ashtrays on the tables._x000D_
_x000D_
My daughter and I returned to Marina Bay Sands they following night (sans husband) and entered via the general viewing entrance ($26SD...or about). This was a great experience. No drink included but it wasn't as crowded and we could get more aspects and photos of the Singapore skyline. Both experiences were worthwhile and two visits was also a good idea too (if you have time)._x000D_

_x000D_
-bring your own stroller or u have to rent a cart( sgd15) or a upright stroller (unsure about pricing). the cart is fun for kids but the upright stroller seems a bit awkard as it looks uncomfortable. i went on by carrying my kid ard and walking+ bus as the carts were all rented out._x000D_
_x000D_
-buy tickets online to avoid the horror of queuing. avoid weekends and school holiday ...you have been warned._x000D_
_x000D_
- check out the attraction and show timing and be there at least 10mins earlier to secure a seat. staff will disallow visitors from going into some of the areas if too crowded. we missed the elephant show due to huge crowd_x000D_
_x000D_
- the food is quite bad by local standards... quite bland to me, but well, no choice as we are hungry._x000D_
_x000D_
- there are so-called open air safari-like busses which circles around the zoo. buy tickets for unlimited usage..worth every penny, and there is a space for putting your strollers on the open air bus. so dun worry about bringing your strollers._x000D_

- most of the areas are open air, so do some weather check before you plan to buy your tickets._x000D_

77760,645288130,2019-01-12 00:00:00.000,5,A must see if visiting Singapore,"My wife and I visited the this attraction on 29th December. When booking you have to choose a slot, the 7:15 was very busy so we chose the 8:15. There was a very cheap and convenient bus that picked us up directly from our hotel which cost roughly Ã‚Â£5 for a return ticket. On arrival we were greeted with the usual long queue, souvenir shops, and food and drink stands. It didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t take too long to get in, maybe 15 minutes. Once in you then have a choice to take the tram tour first, or head out on foot. I recommend you do both as there are some things you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see if you only take one or the other. We decided to walk first, where it becomes a lot less busy. Attractions include giant bats, flying foxes, insects, hyenas, and much more. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be surprised if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see all the animals, as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dark, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s incredibly hard to see some of them if they are hiding. The tram ride is very entertaining depending on the tour guide you get. I recommend you sit at the front, our driver seemed to do his own commentary for those on the front, and he was very entertaining. On the tram ride you see elephants, many types of Deer, rhino, and much more.It was a lovely trip out, however as with any trip in Asia, be prepared to be surrounded by loud Chinese people snorting and spitting everywhere. Ive lived in Hong Kong before, but I still never got used to it. Also itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a shame tourists thought it necessary to bring very young kids and babies to this attraction. We had screaming kids that the parents couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t control which was frustrating - I recommend you go as late as possible to avoid this.All in all - itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lovely to see the animals at night, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also great that the Night Safari invest of lot of their profits into animal conservation. They make it very clear on the tour the destruction humans have caused to natural habitats, and mention the evils of poaching (but stop short of actually blaming the Chinese and Africans for the their use of Ã¢â‚¬Å“traditional medicinesÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ivory which feeds this disgusting business).Definitely go and see this if you have time.

For me, it was a walk of terror and I was hyperventilating by the end! However, overall these gardens are stunning and well worth a visit.

38940,453784668,2017-01-21 00:00:00.000,5,Gardens by the Bay,"This was the highlight of our Singapore trip. The Gardens are easily approachable on the metro and one needs to get off at the Bay front station. The Singapore metro is very user friendly so I recommend you save on cab fares. The gardens are huge glass, air conditioned conservatories, formed like gigantic bubbles that dot the Singapore landscape and are one of the most visible sights in this city from almost anywhere. There are two conservatories- Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. You can visit one or both. Flower dome as the name suggests has flowers and plants from almost all continents and is visually a very colourful treat. The Cloud Forest is more striking because as soon as you enter you see a huge waterfall which is at the centre of this conservatory. You take a few steps in and gradually climb up an aerial walkway that takes you to the top of the waterfall. All around you is tropical, lush vegetation. The aerial walkway is really high and thus quite fascinating as you get a bird's eye view. This is my favourite out of the two though I recommend that you visit both the conservatories. The temperature inside the conservatories is really low and it feels very cold so carry a light jacket._x000D_
Outside the conservatories are the super trees that are tree like tall architectural structures that are connected by another aerial walkway. You have to buy another ticket if you want to go up this one._x000D_
There is a souvenir shop and a small cafeteria that offers thirst quenchers._x000D_

I've never seen structures like these, with the added advantage of all the plants & nice, cool air. You'll definitely want to back-track & experience everything at least once again (perhaps twice again!) but no need. Just get your arm / wrist stamped on your way out & do it again. Save money & buy your tickets on-line. Save your personal thermostat & visit in the heat of the afternoon to make the most of the cool climate inside. Save the crowds for someone else & visit on a weekday. Many attractions in Singapore close on Monday, but this is something that's open every day... still, check on the computer before your visit. About once a month one or the other building's closed for maintenance. In the Flower Dome they have regular themed flower displays. In March they had an Easter theme (bunnies & chocolate eggs) & in April they had a Sakura Matsuri (Japanese cherry blossom festival) theme. It's not cheap to visit, but you'll hate yourself if you miss out!_x000D_
Before your visit you can tour some of the other attractions at Gardens by the Bay, all of which are free. Ethnic gardens, sculptures including Planet (the huge gravity defying baby), topical gardens: cactus, orchid, etc. The area's vast & every turn in the path has something you'll want to see... even if you're not a mad keen garden buff._x000D_
After your visit to the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome, check out the GbbBay things you'd missed earlier, & cool off / rest in Satay by the Bay; the GbbB food centre. They have shady places to sit, cool drinks, & yummy food to suit every budget. Yes, even inexpensive food! The MRT Bayfront has an exit inside GbbB, or you can enter Marina Bay Sands, gawk at everything, take the outside lift to the 3rd or 4th floor (forget which, but everyone will be going there), & walk across the fun & scenic elevated walkway.

BOTTOM LINE: I would not call this a ""must see"" attraction but it is interesting to see and stroll trhough.

ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way too exhausting for the littles but riding the tram around will cover the main animals (rhinos, zebras, giraffes, lions, tigers, some monkeys). Then weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll pick a few exhibits to see and go see those, timing them to coincide with some feedings and a show if the kids want (sea lion show is the best)._x000D_
_x000D_
Feedings we love: hamadryas baboons (I could watch these all day); giraffes (blue tongues!!)_x000D_
_x000D_
Favourite exhibits: fragile forest (up close with a variety of birds and small animals like sloth and mouse deer); those baboons; cheetah (get nice and close thru the glass. It paces quite a bit so good for little ones who find it hard to spot still animals from afar); all the apes and monkeys._x000D_
_x000D_
Playground: this is why you need your swim stuff. We always cap our zoo visit with the water playground because you will surely be hot and sticky and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nothing like jumping in a pool of water to fix that. Slides and fountains galore. Let the kids loose and you can sit aside and veg for a bit. Or if your kids are little, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nice to stand in the pool too. There was minders keeping an eye out but if you have an under 3 year old, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have to be more mindful cos the water is about knee high for an adult. We adore this playground and iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d Keep at least an hour for this if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wanna deal with a lot of whinging about leaving._x000D_
_x000D_
Tip: the day zoo is a full day trip with kids. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t plan to do all three parks or even two in one day. This way, you can go at a non stressful pace and spend as much time as you like staring at one animal._x000D_
Of the three zoo parks, this is the best one for little kids. (Night safari is crowded and small kids find it hard to spot the animals in the dark, river safari was underwhelming for me... plus, no water playground!!)_x000D_
_x000D_
Food: limited options and all crowded. We usually just do KFC at the playground. Pizza and ice cream at the entrance is also good. The restaurants inside are ok too if you really need a nice place to rest. Expect high prices and mediocre fare tho. Of course, you could just pack sandwiches and picnic somewhere._x000D_

42723,435022619,2016-11-06 00:00:00.000,5,Tops the must-see of Singapore,"Absolutely loved this, make sure you do both of the domes (you can buy tickets separately for each) as they are both very different. The flower one is more like a traditional botanic gardens (although inside a climate controlled dome) showcasing floral from all over the world in country-themed spaces, beautifully arranged with some wonderful themed sculptures in amongst the plants. The second dome contains just one huge gloriously green mound several storeys high with waterfalls cascading from its summit. Stunning. Not great if you're scared of heights, although there is a lift if required!_x000D_
_x000D_
Points to note are that it can actually feel a bit chilly inside the domes so do bring something you can wear over your summer top. The cafe in the flower dome was very expensive and service slow, but overall very good. I paid extra to get the shuttle service from the road, it was useful since I didn't know where I was going, but it can't be more than a 5-10 minute walk which does take you through parts of the gardens I missed by taking the shuttle and had to go back anyway, so not really necessary._x000D_
_x000D_
The giant trees are also great to look at, but I didn't do the skywalk as it costs extra. My advice would be to do the cloud dome first as that is a type of skywalk too, and then decide if you want to do the second outdoor skywalk. I got plenty out of it without doing that._x000D_
_x000D_

There are outdoor areas that are free to roam, and that includes the sound and light shows in the evenings. For a fee, you can visit one or both of the Pavilions. It is cheaper to buy the combo ticket, and I highly recommend seeing both. The highlight, however, is the Cloud Forest experience. I've never seen anything quite like it anywhere in the world. Stunning design of both the building and the landscapes. An amazing array of plants. Beautiful dragon sculptures. And since it is climate controlled this is a perfect getaway from the heat and humidity of a summer day. Make sure to stay for at least one of the ""mistings"" where the building is filled with the fine fog that keeps the cloud forests alive. The Flowers pavilion has a mind boggling collection of plants, flowers, and even huge trees from around the world.

There was children museum that the kids were excited to visit within the gallery.

102447,365297717,2016-04-19 00:00:00.000,4,Imperialism and nationalism,"Recently, I organized an educational visit for my residents to the NEWater Visitor Center and the Changi Chapel Museum. Since we have a large group of residents, I sent in a notification of visit to the museum for approval and it was approved without much query._x000D_
_x000D_
At any one time, the museum can only accommodate 120 persons including walk-ins and groups and reserves the right to reject any visitor who come unannounced. The approval on the notification of visit is just an acknowledgement and does not mean that a guided tour is provided for the visit. Although admission is free, guided tour is charged._x000D_
_x000D_
We arrived at the museum at about 9.10 am but the entrance was locked as it only opens at 9.30 am. We waited patiently in the bus as the weather was extremely hot on that day. There were also few foreign visitors waiting outside the gate and by the time it opened at 9.30 am, we swarmed into the air-conditioned exhibition hall like school children going into the classroom._x000D_
_x000D_
This is the second time I visited the museum. It has not changed much since the last time I visited few years ago. Many of my residents were Mandarin speaking and I did my best to translate into Mandarin of what was on the exhibition panels. Most felt disgusted by the horrible sight of decapitated heads and starved skeletal bodies of the Prisoners of War._x000D_

Few of the `old aunties' residents who had suffered miserably during the Japanese invasion recalled the terrible massacre of the innocents and living in fear and phobia throughout the 3 years and 8 months of Japanese tyrannical rule._x000D_
_x000D_
Millions of precious lives perished during the Second World War. In my opinion, it was a war between the imperialist titans to capture and plunder the resources of the lands they lay their hands on._x000D_
_x000D_
The Allied Powers represented the western colonial powers who had stretched their claws into Asia much more earlier than the Japanese. The White Rajah were in Borneo; the Spaniards in Philippines, the French in Indo-China, the Dutch in Batavia and the Portuguese in Melaka._x000D_
_x000D_
The Meiji Restoration changed Japan into a technological advanced powerful nation who can challenged the Western imperialists and when both titans fight for resources, the impoverished and innocent people of the lands they plundered became the scapegoat and victims of the war._x000D_
_x000D_
Singapore is one of those lands exploited by the British East Indies Company as a port for trade to the Far East. The Fall of Singapore was from the clutch of one British imperialists to the tyrannical Japanese imperialists. Both the British and the Japanese were here to serve their own interests. Not only the locals suffered but the faithful and loyal servants of the British Colonial armed forces also suffered miserably during the wars. Many of them perished when they were sent to Burma to build the deadly railway._x000D_
_x000D_
The Second World War woke up the minds of those `stupid' people who lived on lands exploited by the colonialists and imperialists. The rise of nationalism open the eyes of those innocent people who were treated like servants by their colonial masters._x000D_

77740,645282932,2019-01-12 00:00:00.000,5,Highly recommended,"I first visited the Night Safari more than 20 years ago. It was not a good experience as the animals were kept too far away under extremely dim lighting which did not allow us to spot many animals. My most recent visit was therefore a pleasant surprise. We started with the 40minute tram ride which gives a comprehensive tour of the main attractions of the safari (tigers, lions, elephants, hippos etc). We were a party of 4 adults and 4 young children, so this was a fantastic way to see the zoo. The audio guide was informative, the stops were long enough for us to spot the animals, and the enclosures were well planned and beautiful, allowing visitors a good view of the animals (the lighting was dim but sufficient, a good compromise for the comfort of the nocturnal animals and visitors).

The rustic setting and lovely greenery calm one's mind and was a great relief to the hectic and stressful tempo of urban living._x000D_

Little do I know of the migration of hundred species of shore birds from the northern hemisphere to the south hemisphere of the Earth in search of warmth and food. The unbearable harsh winter accompanied by the scarcity of food prompted these birds to migrate in order to adapt to the ecological change .The risks were high. A substantial number of them perished out of fatigue and physical exhaustion. Many others ended up on the hunters' food plates while many more died of hunger._x000D_
_x000D_
It is fortunate that these birds could find a rest house like this wetland reserve for them to rejuvenate and recharge their energy so as to continue their long distance flight be it return to the north or migrate to the South. Color flagging and implanting satellites were interesting effort taken to study and monitor their flight pathway. One unconventional flight path discovered was the flight taken via the Himalayan mountains._x000D_
_x000D_
The work taken to preserve wildlife species from crocodiles to fruit bats, snakes, to migratory birds were significant, remarkable and impressive. I learnt a lot from our NPark guides during today's visit. The enriched learning experience invigorates my curiosity of the world of migratory birds._x000D_

There was a range of colouring pages to choose from. Crayons and wet tissue were supplied. Both children and adults were delighted when they scanned in their colouring pages and saw their 2D creations become 3D ones in large interactive screens.

1. The Night Safari_x000D_
This was excellent and definitely worth doing. I would recommend to forget dinner and more fully explore the zoo. Really this is not a sight to miss. So 9/10 for this part only_x000D_
_x000D_
2. The Zoo Restaurant_x000D_
This was okay. A little over priced but the food was good and the range was excellent. Unless you have plenty of time I would skip eating here and more fully explore the Restaurant. So 6/10 alone._x000D_
_x000D_
3. Viator and Tour East - Singapore who offer the specific tour_x000D_
Really this part was a shocker!! We were picked up early from our motel, only to be dropped in china town to wait then change buses to wait again before heading towards the zoo. Well we lost an hour in this fiasco. Then when we arrived we were shuffled to the Restaurant for another hour. Then shuffled to a holding yard to wait again and then another holding pen to wait again before boarding the tram._x000D_
The tram ride was awesome (see above) but then we had lost too much time we couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see the live animal show but we were taken for a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtrail walkÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Some eight minutes into the trail walk, our guide decided that we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have time to complete it so turned around and went back to the entrance saying Ã¢â‚¬Å“just look at the shops for 20 minuetsÃ¢â‚¬Â. So given the very poor logistics we got to see less than a third of the zoo and only one show of two. This wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be as bad if the advertising didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say Ã¢â‚¬Å“Use your skip-the-line pass to the Night Safari tram for priority boarding, and spend your 4 hours exploring the nighttime rainforest rather than waiting in lineÃ¢â‚¬Â. Sorry we got less than two hours to Ã¢â‚¬Ëœexplore the zooÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and although the zoo was great the tour was embarrassingly poorly organised. I would rate them 1/10 (at least we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get lost)._x000D_

The light show in the evening is worth making sure you are there for. There are two shows, 19:45 & 20:45. We went to the 19:45 show as we were already there. It is always going to be the busiest one as people time their visits to finish at that point (at a guess). Hint - the display is in the Super Tree Grove and you need to be able to at least see some of all of the three biggest trees as they work together to create the display. We wondered down at the start time and sat on the floor as people start to congregate very early to wait for the start. If you need a seat and want to be able to see everything then head down around 30m beforehand. We were happy to stand/sit on the floor._x000D_

When inside, we walked around the zoo because the queue was too long to wait for the safari bus (we were told it would be at least a half hour plus wait). The walk around the zoo itself was interesting and the children delighted in finding all the animals along the way. Amazing how all the animals looked so much bigger at nighttime - particularly the lions. Long stretches of paths with no animals where we weren't sure if we were heading in the right direction - some additional attendants would be useful from a way finding perspective. We did a few unnecessary laps of the same enclosure a few times. Another tedious queue for the show (another 40 minutes) - again another missed opportunity for some entertainment (or education) while everyone waited about in lines. Maybe it was exceptionally busy because it was a Saturday night and perhaps it isn't always that busy.

Good choices for both the adults and kids but just one issue was the ventilation. Tends to be a bit warm but canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t complain as the zoo is an outdoor place and Singapore tends to be rather humid throughout the year. The Zoo itself was clean and there was lots to see. It was refreshing to see some new facilities from our last visit like a mini playground for kids near the Orang Utans enclosure. DidnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel that it was too crowded if you set off before 11am. The crowds started to come in by 12noon and the cafes inside were packed and so were the trams. My advice is to just walk if it permits. You get to see so much more. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget to catch the splash and elephant shows as well as getting the kids to try feeding the various animals during feeding time. Fun experience and will be back. Suggestion for the zoo is to install those mist fans throughout the zoo.

_x000D_
We were both really looking forward to our visit to Singapore Zoo, it rained ever so slightly to begin with but it wasn't a problem as there was shelter. I couldn't understand some reviews that said that there wasn't, or that it was a long way from one enclosure to another, I didn't find this to be the case. We paid extra $5 for the unlimited tram rides just in case, but it was well worth it just for the novelty & ideal to rest young & old legs, but not really necessary. It's the best zoo I've ever been to, & you can get great photos of all the animals without cages or bars ruining it. The animals looked fit & healthy too. As much as I love the zoo, I still struggle with the out in the wild thing too. I loved the giraffe, hippo, tigers, lions, meerkats, reptiles, monkeys Ã¢â‚¬Â¦. but the orangutan always steals my heart. The animals all put on the performance of a lifetime, & we got great photos & video footage of their poses & antics. Shame about the elephant show, it was absolutely packed, so get there early if you want front row seats. I would've preferred to see them without all the fuss, although I understand that some people enjoy this, perhaps the elephants do too. We had a fantastic time & spent about 5 hours here, & took away many souvenirs too.

To get to the Zoo, we hopped on an MRT to Chao Chu Kang MRT station (1.5 hours from Orchard Road) and bus #927 (15min) that drops you directly at the front gates._x000D_
_x000D_
We bought our pass online via the Singapore Zoo website (S$55 per adult for 2 parks with5% discount if purchased online) and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to queue at the long line at the Zoo. We did the Zoo and the River Safari on the one day, in my opinion, two parks is plenty for one day, unless you only spend a few seconds at each exhibit. There are so much to see and the sea lions (splash) show is a must. We also made the elephant show which was amazing to see these gentle giants work with their mahouts effortlessly. There are various feeding times for different animals, so it is good to plan your visit so you make the most of what you want to see. There is a tram (additional S$5 per adult) that takes you around the Zoo it is an easy way to get from one section to another. There is plenty of shade around the Zoo so although it could get quite hot and humid, the surroundings tree canopies offer good shelter while walking around. We had lunch at the Ah Meng restaurant that offered hawker type stalls with a variety of local food. The River Safari is only couple of minutes walk away from the Zoo, be sure to purchase the River Safari boat ride as some of the animals are only viewable from the boat ride S$5 per adult) you are able to go on the ride again as we missed some animals on one side. The queue could get quite long, but it is well worth the wait. There is another reservoir boat cruise that is included in the River Safari ticket but you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t to see any animals except the giraffes or the rhinos, if you are lucky. The giant fish tank with the Dugongs are awesome, I could easily sit there watching them all day in the air conditioned comfort!

You can take the MRT to here.The entrance from MRT offer you a S$3.00 for a daily shuttle from MRT exits to the main ticketing office. It is not far at all. Just about less than 1 km walk. I thought the shuttle will be go all over the 100 hectare park. So it was a bit disappointing. You better not take it and enjoy the walk to the main ticketing office along the garden pathway._x000D_

The best time to come here is at 4 pm onward, since the sun heat was not that hot. There are 2 domes which you can enter with a fee of S$24. I did not take it so I don't know what to say. But however, from the outside I can see that this must be fantastic. If you plan to come to the dome, you better come earlier than 4 pm as your ticket is valid for both dome only for one day. And I don't think it is hot inside the dome. So you can still enjoy it while the sun is burning out there._x000D_

There is also OCBC Skywalk which I was about to take before I realize that the skywalk queue line is very long. Due to safety, they limit the number of people to the skywalk.

1) cloud dome_x000D_
2) flower dome_x000D_
3) super tree grove_x000D_
_x000D_
I would highly recommend going to the first 2 domes. Start there, when you purchase your tickets you should ask the attendant which dome you should visit first. At the time I was there she recommended the cloud dome first because they were about to start the misting. Which involves hundreds of mini pipes pumping mist into the atmosphere._x000D_
It was a truly magical time._x000D_
Then make your way to the flower dome._x000D_
I would recommend going to the super tree grove towards sunset as you would want to get tickets to reach the top of the tree grove walkway and watch the sunset and also the light show when the sun is down. They only allow you to stay up the walkway for about 30 mins so a little planning is good._x000D_
_x000D_
After that make your way to the walkway by the water and you can either walk towards the Shoppe for a spot to eat or enjoy the view of the largest Ferris wheel in Asia._x000D_

(See photo) The Supertrees are 25-50 meters tall, and one of the trees is as high as a 16 story building. The tops of some of the trees contain photovoltaic cells, which collect energy from the sun. The Supertrees are actually vertical gardens, with climbing plants from all over the world growing up the sides. There are diagrams and information on how the trees collect, store and distribute energy and some act as air exhausts. (See photo) Visiting the gardens and the Supertrees from the ground is free._x000D_

There is also an ariel walkway 22 meters off the ground (OCBC Skyway) which winds around between several of the trees. (See photos) The cost to access the Skyway is 8 Singapore dollars per adult.

51463,376656258,2016-05-26 00:00:00.000,5,"Great place for nature-lovers, to relax, and to get peace","Chinese Garden, in my opinion, is one of the underrated sites in Singapore. The whole area - which is unlike less developed places such as MacRitchie Reservoir or Pulau Ubin Island - is beautifully built and maintained, while at the same time it doesn't feel commercial like Sentosa._x000D_
_x000D_
It is easily accessible via Chinese Garden MRT, or you can bike to and around the whole place. Walking throughout the park could take you anywhere between one to three hours depending on how much you want to cover the gardens, and how much time you want to spend on photography._x000D_
_x000D_
The park is extremely scenic, with countless photographic opportunities especially around the eveneing. The vastness of the park also allows it to be isolated from the hassle of the city as well as not to feel crowded. Must-see sights include the Twin Pagodas (near the Jurong Lake), the 7-story Pagoda, Bonsai Garden (do not miss!), and the Japanese Garden. The Japanese Garden specifically had that feeling of being away from all the city hustle, like I felt I was in a rather heavenly, peaceful, serene place._x000D_
_x000D_
This is a place to go, exercise, and/or relax especially if you live in the West area. Highly recommended._x000D_
_x000D_
Tips:_x000D_
* Bonsai Garden is open until 5pm, while the 7-story Pagoda and the Japanese Garden are open until 7pm. The rest of the park operates until 11pm (officially, I'm not sure if people can still visit afterwards)._x000D_
* Try climbing up the 7-story Pagoda before 7pm - sunset (e.g. ~6:50pm) to have a nice view of the sunsest behind the Jurong Lake._x000D_
* Bring water or drinks if you're exercising or staying longer. There are a few water fountains near toilets, but they were hardly usable the day I was there. Same goes with the snacks if you don't want to go to the MRT for convenience stores._x000D_
* If you don't mind some extra walking, you can either start at Jurong Lake MRT and finish at Chinese Garden MRT, or vice versa. The lake is a nice place to walk around especially in the evening and around sunset._x000D_

Getting there is easy on the MRT then zoo shuttle. Get off at Khatib station,then line up for the shuttle otherwise the line can get large and you might miss the bus as they are random sizes from mini bus to coach. Ensure you have $1 on your MRT card or buy physical ticket from a booth in the station._x000D_
_x000D_
Take your own water bottle as there are water filling stations everywhere. It gets hot and lots of walking, so drink lots._x000D_
_x000D_
As with any zoo, some animals you might see, others you might not. If you miss out on seeing some, it's not the end of the world and you may feel ripped off, but they are animals and can do what they like._x000D_
_x000D_
Lunch in the central restaurant was nice, but has limited seating. Would avoid at lunch time and go earlier or after. It is not that expensive and tasty enough._x000D_
_x000D_
Plenty of things for kids to do apart from seeing animals. Tram ride, play ground, ropes course for kids over a certain height or age ( our son was either too small or too young, can't remember)._x000D_

Unfortunately you won't see a polar bear, I was sad to see that the resident polar bear had passed away from natural causes a year or two ago. I had seen it about 5 years ago and it was amazing._x000D_

The shuttle will drop you at the ticket counter for the two domes. Normal price for adult is 28$ (for 1 dome). But for Singaporeans, PR holders and working pass holders price is 12$. And if you have either watsons or passion card, there will be additional 10% discount. In the end I paid only 10.80$ for this wonderful visit! Thank you GBTB!!!

98442,468035289,2017-03-17 00:00:00.000,2,Artists in Empire,"This exhibition was very disappointing. Tickets are quite expensive - and the gallery follows the nasty practice of charging more for anybody who doesn't live in Singapore. The selection of art is sometimes interesting: the way the colonists viewed the alien peoples they found themselves ruling over is a good subject. But it misinterprets: Australian landscape artists, for example, are depicted as an instance of growing awareness of independent nationality. At the end of the 19th century, Australians would have thought of themselves as south British; national consciousness came much later. And the pictures of native peoples at the height of Empire are an incomplete depiction of how the colonists viewed the ""subject peoples"". For instance, the notorious Hottentot Venus is missing - and there is no mention of how aboriginal people's remains were taken to the mother country as curiosities. Sometimes the colonists showed a fair contempt for the natives. The West Indian colonies and Africa get little coverage and there is nothing about the opium trade and the Chinese expeditions of the 19th century. Worst of all, some of the exhibits are quite small and are behind glass; you cannot see them properly because the gallery people have painted lines on the floor a fair way from the art works - and you are forbidden to cross the line. In true Singapore control freak mode, when you go into a section of the gallery an attendant will emerge and silently shadow you. There may be some point in keeping people away from an unprotected large oil painting, but doing this to a 30cm by 30cm print in a glass frame simply means that nobody can see the thing properly. This was an inadequate exhibition spoiled by the way the items were over-protected, and I didn't think it was worth the excessive entrance fee.",2017-02-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-30 13:11:21.720,Ian C,United Kingdom,National Gallery Singapore,"Art, History & Culture","1 St. Andrew's Road #01-01 National Gallery Singapore, Singapore 178957, Singapore",exhibition disappoint ticket quite expensive gallery follow nasty practice charge anybody not live singapore selection art sometimes interest way colonist view alien people found ruling good subject misinterprets australian landscape artist example depict instance grow awareness independent nationality end th century australian would thought south british national consciousness come much later picture native people height empire incomplete depiction colonist view subject people instance notorious hottentot venus miss mention aboriginal people remains take mother country curiosity sometimes colonist show fair contempt native west indian colony africa get little coverage nothing opium trade chinese expedition th century bad exhibit quite small behind glass can not see properly gallery people paint line floor fair way art work forbidden cross line true singapore control freak mode go section gallery attendant emerge silently shadow may point keep people away unprotected large oil painting cm cm print glass frame simply mean nobody see thing properly inadequate exhibition spoil way item protect not think worth excessive entrance fee,Artwork Quality

The Night Safari is one of the best (if not, the best) attraction in Singapore and is certainly one of a kind._x000D_
_x000D_
Located in the North of Singapore you can take a taxi there or a bus. If driving parking is really easy._x000D_
_x000D_
If you read some of the reviews, there was points deducted for poor food or crowds. Well it is the zoo, don't go there for food unless you really have very little time. And being the best attraction in Singapore and one of the very few things you can do at night of course it would be crowded._x000D_
_x000D_
How to Enjoy The Park_x000D_
_x000D_
For me there is only one way to go about enjoying the night safari which is to go right when the park opens, and once you enter, avoid the tram queue and avoid the show. Go straight to the walking trail. This would allow you to enjoy the environment, be relatively away from the noise and get to see the animals up close without the pressure of being pushed forward. The trail would take u an hour or more and you should take your time. This will bring you to a sort of pit stop with a tram stop. Do not take the tram here. Do go to the tram stop and walk on as it has a small path beyond it to bring you to the giraffes. Many people don't notice that. The other thing to note at the pit stop is to find the lion look out._x000D_
_x000D_
Continue walking from the pit stop on the next trail and you will see lots of stuff. Eventually you will return to the main entrance. It is one big loop and its a good 1-2 hrs walk. Take your time enjoy it. Now at the main entrance you can go to see the show. The idea is to take the tram ride as late as possible. That is where the queues are the shortest and sometimes u get to choose where to sit on the tram._x000D_
_x000D_
I usually leave at closing time. But I have time for everything and if really want, i can go on the tram more than once._x000D_
_x000D_
So walk the trail, see the show, take the tram._x000D_

We spent 1.5 days, and it wasn't enough time. On the first day, we had friends drop us off at the front main entrance (drop off/pick-up for taxis, coaches, etc) and we explored the main attractions - Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest for a fee. If you don't like cool/chilly air, bring a cardigan._x000D_

On the second day we arrived by the back entrance - by train to Bayfront MRT station - then a 10-minute walk to the Gardens by the Bay transit hub. From here, you can walk (about 10-15 minutes) or take a S$3/pax shuttle (unlimited, all day) ride to Flower Dome/Cloud Forest._x000D_
_x000D_
We bought tickets for the Audio shuttle tour (includes complimentary shuttle in, but return you have to either walk it or pay $3 for the shuttle back to the transit hub) for an overview of the gardens, which is a great introduction to how extensive and different the gardens are and should be the first thing to do (we opted to do this on the second day)._x000D_
_x000D_
The night light and sound show at the Supergrove trees is 15 minutes long and you should be seated facing the tallest of the trees (where there is a rooftop bar at the top). The Skyway was closed because of weather, so we ended up paying S$12/pax for a soft drink and access to the rooftop bar (Level 16) for the view before going down to see the light show._x000D_

After the light show, there is an exodus of people. The taxi queue was very long (looking at a one-hour wait), so use a ride-hailing app (no queue for this).

Once there, you may stand in front of the platform and have your photo taken. Understandably, you are NOT permitted to touch the orang-utans, but it's a memorable experience. All the animals seemed well cared for and in an appropriate environment. The only animal I did feel sorry for was the polar bear, who looked somewhat solemn and his enclosure was a little stark (not sure he was enjoying the Singapore humidity).

85938,447032329,2016-12-28 00:00:00.000,4,Possibly Best Hiking Trail in Singapore,"Singapore is predominantly an urban city. This is probably the closest thing to a hike that you can get in Singapore. Set aside a minimum of 2 hours for the hike itself. Add more time if you will be stopping anywhere._x000D_
_x000D_
Suggested things to bring: water, poncho or umbrella (in case of sudden rain), ziplock for your precious phone, and of course money (in case you need to buy food/drinks or give up and take train back!)._x000D_
_x000D_
As Singapore weather can get rather hot in the late morning, I would suggest starting at around 7 am. Start from the start point beside the motorbike parking lots, in between Seah Im Food Centre and Marang Road. It's on the east (not west) side of the food centre. You can have breakfast at the food centre before the hike, and wash up at the not-so-clean toilets before the hike. This start point is just next to HarbourFront MRT Station._x000D_
_x000D_
From there, you hike up a series of steps up Mount Faber to the cable car station. This is the Marang Trail. Then you proceed onto the Faber Trail, with panoramic vies of the Southern Part of Singapore. You end up at Henderson Waves, the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore at 36 metres above Henderson Road._x000D_
_x000D_
Crossing Henderson Waves, you end up in Hilltop Walk, then Forest Walk leading to Alexandra Arch. At this place, you have the option of proceeding westwards towards Flora Walk, HortPark, Canopy Walk and eventually Ken Ridge Park. Or you can turn southwards towards the Labrador Nature & Costal Walk. Normally, at Alexandra Arch, I turn back. Time taken for a normal walk is 1 hour to reach Alexandra Arch and another hour for the return trip. Total distance to Alexandra Arch and back is about 9 km._x000D_
_x000D_
If you are hungry on your return trip, you can get down from Henderson Waves, move northwards towards Telok Blangah Way and locate this place called SAFRA Mount Faber. You can try local coffee (kopi) and toast at Ya Kun. Or you can soldier on and return back to Seah Im Food Centre to try other local food including Indian Rojak._x000D_
_x000D_
Oh I forgot. If you decide to give up at Alexandra Arch, you can navigate southwards to Labrador Park MRT station. Or you can always hail a taxi or Uber from Hort Park!",2016-10-01 00:00:00.000,Friends,2020-01-30 05:29:31.903,74kst,Singapore,The Southern Ridges,Nature & Wildlife,"Alexandra Road | Mount Faber Park; Telok Blangah Hill Park; or Kent Ridge Park, Singapore 099203, Singapore",singapore predominantly urban city probably closest thing hike get singapore set aside minimum hour hike add time stop anywherexd xd suggest thing bring water poncho umbrella case sudden rain ziplock precious phone course money case need buy fooddrinks give take train back xd xd singapore weather get rather hot late morning would suggest start around start start point beside motorbike parking lot seah im food centre marang road east not west side food centre breakfast food centre hike wash not clean toilet hike start point next harbourfront mrt stationxd xd hike series step mount faber cable car station marang trail proceed onto faber trail panoramic vies southern part singapore end henderson wave high pedestrian bridge singapore metre henderson roadxd xd cross henderson wave end hilltop walk forest walk lead alexandra arch place option proceed westward towards flora walk hortpark canopy walk eventually ken ridge park turn southward towards labrador nature costal walk normally alexandra arch turn back time take normal walk hour reach alexandra arch another hour return trip total distance alexandra arch back kmxd xd hungry return trip get henderson wave move northward towards telok blangah way locate place call safra mount faber try local coffee kopi toast ya kun soldier return back seah im food centre try local food include indian rojakxd xd oh forgot decide give alexandra arch navigate southward labrador park mrt station always hail taxi uber hort park,Interaction with Animals

Ryan was our tour guide on the day I popped in and was able to pay the $18SGD to jump on the 4PM tour. I am so glad I did. Your ticket price helps take care of the Battle Box and you cannot step foot inside without a ticket and without going on a tour. The tour takes about an hour and 15 minutes. The Battle Box itself is directly behind the Fort Canning hotel. It is also located into Fort Canning Park, which is a lovely place to simply walk around, enjoy the greenery and take in the history of this area. The Battle Box is located within maybe a 15-20 minute walk from the Fort Canning MRT station, but do note that a good chunk of that walk is vertically up a hill or up stairs._x000D_

Ryan was an excellent guide. Not exactly jovial, but absolutely well versed in his docent skills and pays excellent attention to the historical details and information he is giving you.

You could ride the train through the quiet jungle to hear the big carnivores roaring, awesome! 5 stars without a doubt._x000D_
However, more recently they have unfortunately turner the park into a money-making-group-site where you must enter the park at a specific slot, so any dinner you want to enjoy in the safari hawker at the entrance must be well scheduled&lucky with the queues. The train is no longer hop-on hop-off but you need to ride it nonstop from start to finish and do whatever walking you want to do separately. Even worse is the fact that nowadays they have installed 50 speakers throughout the train so you must listen to a teenager unenthusiasticly repeat the same jargon (s)he has said 500 times over, and the speakers are set so loud that you will not hear any animals, so it is more like watching TV..

Sadly, we did not have time for the Gem Exhibition or the Digital world, but would have enjoyed them if we had more time. One annoyance, common to many Singapore attractions, is that visitors are charged more, often significantly more in the case of seniors, than locals.

92451,646153750,2019-01-16 00:00:00.000,5,The Best Mahayana Temple in Southeast Asia,"I am not a great fan of SingaporeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chinatown. However, the Buddha Tooth Temple IS impressive. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the best Mahayana Buddhist temple IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen in Southeast Asia (its closest competitor, in Medan, is huge, but modern architecture). Although less than 50 years old, this temple can bear comparison with many of the historic temples you see in China itself. The architecture is based on northern Chinese temple architecture of the Tang Dynasty (1300 years ago, and chiefly known in the West for colourful Tang ceramic horses and camels, and the infamous Empress Wu)._x000D_
_x000D_
The buildingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s huge exterior may be the #1 photo-op in Chinatown: itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only competition is the temple interior (See Temple Facade photo). The main hall is dominated by a stunning golden Maitreya, flanked by two golden Bodhisattvas. A Maitreya is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“future BuddhaÃ¢â‚¬Â who is to re-enlighten the world during a dark age when mankind has lost all sense of dharma. Bodhisattvas are holy men or women who have attained extremely high levels of dharma, and are on the cusp of total enlightenment themselves, but refrain, in order to instruct and raise up humanity. Historically, numerous rebellions have swept over China in which the rebels stirred up support by claiming that a dark age was upon us, and the Maitreya was about to come. Taoists were welcome to participate on grounds that the current emperor had lost the mandate of Heaven. The concept is not entirely unlike extreme millennialism in Christianity, and the catastrophic Taiping rebellion actually combined all three religions. Blaming any of the three religions on the carnage is unfair (see Maitreya and Boddhisatvas photo, and Maitreya Closeup photos)._x000D_
_x000D_
A gentler side of Buddhism can be seen on the opposite, northwestern half of the ground floor, where a multi-armed compassionate deity with beautiful pastel colours is flanked by guardian Tang Dynasty warriors. For lack of positive identification, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll call the god AvalokiteÃ…â€ºvara (see Compassionate Deity photo). But it might be the Chinese goddess of Mercy, Guan Yin. My Buddhist Thai partner thinks the statue is of Ã¢â‚¬Å“Phra Kuan ImÃ¢â‚¬Â: i.e. Princess Guan Yin. Could be either. They both often have multiple arms, allowing them to reach out in half a dozen different directions to assist people who pray for help; vastly increasing the number and scope of their benevolent responses. (Kyoto has a temple with 1,001 thousand-armed KannonsÃ¢â‚¬â€Guan YinsÃ¢â‚¬â€which works out to 1,001,000 compassionate interventions!)_x000D_
_x000D_
With better timing, Nok and I could have easily determined who the multi-armed deity was. We were doing a two-week whistle-stop tour of four SE Asian countries with American friends whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never been to the Far East. Due to that schedule, we werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t in Singapore on a Saturday. If you WILL be in Singapore on a Saturday, you can join a free two-hour English-language guided tour of the complete complex. You have to apply in advance to the temple, on-line. If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re unfamiliar with Buddhism, I recommend you try to get into one of these free tours. And if you do, please do me a favour: ask your guide which benevolent deity this one actually is, and mention that in your TA review!_x000D_
_x000D_
Definitely go upstairs as well. There are two museums aloft, and one relic chamber. The more interesting museum to me (and probably to you) is the Buddhist Culture Museum, which holds Buddhist artifacts from throughout Asia. Their collection of these artifacts is not as good as that of the Museum of Asian Art in San Francisco, where Asian history and culture are traced for 2500 years via Buddhist statues and images. But thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a huge difference: in SFÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MAA, the curators and most visitors take a decidedly secular perspective of these statuesÃ¢â‚¬â€just as folks seeing the Venus de Milo donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actually worship Greek goddesses. Here, the BCMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s emphasis is very much on the religious meaning and significance of the pieces in their collection._x000D_

Perhaps it's the location - either open spaces or greenery, makes the events feel NOT claustrophobic (which most city or heartland events tend to be). But also perhaps Gardens By the Bay did not spare any effort - they gave their all - in ensuring every event is big and impressive, and caters to big crowd. As such, despite the throng of visitors / participants, it was still a pleasant experience._x000D_
_x000D_
The best thing of all, most events are either one-time entry fee, and crafts and activities are free. Only food is payable. For the latest one I took my kids to, there was even no entrance fee. So it was pure enjoyment, especially when one has a whole bunch of kids. We don't often go out because it is expensive taking a big family out. So, thanks for Gardens By The Bay events, there is somewhere I can take my kids to._x000D_

The only thing I wish is perhaps to have more air-conditioned activities. I know that sounds contradictory to being in a garden.

This is a zoo not a safari, but the animals seem fairly relaxed and are very visible. My advice is to ignore the trams and the show and the crowds and to make the effort to walk and you will be very well rewarded. The trails are good, well marked and easy to follow even in the dark.

_x000D_
Gardens by the Bay is a wonderful and totally unique attraction and the two conservatories are (in my view) the standouts. The Cloud Forest replicates the rainforest conditions found in tropical mountain regions and has a huge 35m man made waterfall which you can get to the top of via elevator and slowly descend down via an elevated walkway. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stunningly beautiful with some beautiful plant life on display including different types of ferns and orchids._x000D_
_x000D_
The Flower Dome is actually the largest conservatory in the world and houses plant life from Mediterranean and semi-arid regions (there are some excellent cacti and succulent plants on display). It is larger than Cloud Dome but does not have multiple levels and a sky walk like the Cloud Dome._x000D_
_x000D_
Both conservatories are cooled and eco-friendly with rainwater collected and circulated throughout._x000D_
_x000D_
Tip - you can buy individual tickets to each dome separately for the same price. The Cloud Forest Dome has a lot more to see and do than the Flower Dome in my opinion (including 2 excellent short films on climate change in the Cloud Dome Theatre) so if you are pressed for time I would choose Cloud Forest. Tickets are also cheaper if you book online the day before (save $5)._x000D_

_x000D_
Don't misunderstand me, this park is beautiful (as I will describe further down), I am just warning you that Singapore isn't precisely the most harmonic place with nature as it has been heavily built to accommodate its residents._x000D_
_x000D_
Nevertheless, you can come to this park via bus or train and the entrance has some clear signs telling you when you are getting into monkey territory (asking you not to feed the animals)._x000D_
_x000D_
If you have never been to a nature reserve I should tell you, bring water, comfortable shoes and, in case you want to do the full walk, something to eat. Is impressive how many residents come here just to exercise and have a chat. Going up is not super demanding, there is footpath almost all the way and you might have a treat or two when monkeys, chipmunks, lizards and various birds pop out the vegetation to give you a little private show before disappearing into the vegetation once more._x000D_
_x000D_
The trek is relatively easy, you will see a lot of elderly people going by you having a chat and trying to get their workout on their way... That being said, if you are unfit or you have mobility issues I will highly recommend you to take the trek with a complete attitude of ""I will chill out and I don't need to do everything"". I say this because, Singapore is quite warm, meaning you will be sweating and overheating easily, meaning if you are not careful you can dehydrate yourself and pass out._x000D_
_x000D_
As several other people have mentioned here, bring comfortable footwear and lots of water. We didn't need a bug spray but the part we underestimated was how much water we were going to consume and by the end of the trek we had our mouth completely dry and were looking for a convenience store or a shop of sorts to get water._x000D_
_x000D_
The full trek can be 10 kilometres (or a bit more). It really depends on how much you want to explore. We started quick energetic and on our way back, the heat made us slow down quite significantly because of our lack of water and dehydration. Good fun though._x000D_
_x000D_
If you are coming to see the animals be aware that this is not service-on-demand, on our first 6 kilometres we saw no animal what-so-ever and I was starting to get a little disappointed. After a short stop, a local told us that we were walking behind a really low group and animals tend to hide and pointed out we needed to find a quiet space among the crowd to get a chance to see something. It was not easy, as I mentioned before, there is a lot of people (at least when we went there) but found a gap and did the walk, after 10 minutes two monkeys came out, chasing a chipmunk that was adorable. Both of them froze on the spot when they saw us, stood there, giving us a hard look for a minute or two and continued their merry way. In my opinion, the animals were hard to spot in the beginning because you are not sure what are you looking for. Once you have spotted one or two it becomes easier to find them as you pay more attention to the subtle changes of the vegetation._x000D_
_x000D_
By the way, the last tip... if you have food with you, keep it in a place that is sealed. We had half a sandwich which we tucked in our bag's external pocket and as we were walking out, my missus told me ""Honey, what did you do to the sandwich?""_x000D_
Looking at it, we could notice the wrapping paper was torn out and someone gave it a bite or two. I honestly don't know when it happened but I am going to guess that it wasn't a sleeping monkey._x000D_

37289,461865348,2017-02-22 00:00:00.000,5,Visiting Marina Bay Sands Hotel's SkyPark Observation Deck and Famous Swimming Pool by Comfortable Bus 106 from Orchard,"Marian Bay Sands Hotel's SkyPark Observation Deck is a very popular attraction to the visitors to Singapore._x000D_
The SkyPark's observation deck is soaring to 57 levels from the ground, and the hotel's swimming pool on its ship-shaped roof top is breathtaking. You don't have to be the hotel's guests to go up to the SkyPark and view the swimming pool. There is an easy way to travel to Marian Bay Sands Hotel by comfortable Bus 106 from Orchard Road at the bus stop in front of Concorde Hotel Singapore. Bus ride takes about 15 minutes and bus frequency is about 12 minutes. Singapore's smart transit card EZ-Link can be used for the ride with one way adult fare of about US$ 0.70. Cash adult fare is about US$ 1.00. [Minors, students, and seniors pay discounted fares]: (1) Direction by Bus 106: Go to the bus stop in front of Concorde Hotel Singapore (100 Orchard Road). Take Bus 106. After about 10 minutes, look outside carefully. When the bus crosses over a bridge with bay water below, get ready to get off the bus. Once the bus stops, get off the bus (This is Marina Bay Sands stop). (2) Walk back the way your bus has just come (along BayFront Avenue) until you come to the entrance to the hotel's Tower 3 on the right hand side. Before entering Tower 3, look for a separate structure in front of the Tower 3 entrance, and enter this structure instead of entering Tower 3 entrance. --> Go down to the lower level by escalator to the ticket counter area. The SkyPark visiting hours are 9.30 am~10.00 Pm on M~Th and 9.30 am~11.00 Pm on F~S. The adult admission ticket is S$ 23.00, and discount tickets are available for Seniors, Students and minors. (3) Before buying tickets, look at the observation deck tour schedule board on the wall, or ask the ticket agents the nearest tour time which includes free visit to the roof top swimming pool. Then, buy ticket(s) for the tour that includes free visit to the swimming pool area. If you have to wait for long for the next tour which includes the swimming pool visit, you can still buy the ticket, and then go inside Tower 3 for a visit to the lower level restaurant/casino/shop complex until 30 minutes before the tour time. Then, return to the tour ticket counter area for your tour at least 5 minutes before the tour time. (4) At your tour time, you will be asked to go through the usual photo session before being allowed to go up to the observation deck. At the observation deck, a tour guide will let you have a free time to enjoy the fantastic view of Singapore city and harbor before assembling at the designated location for your free tour of the rooftop swimming pool area. You will then have a brief visit to the swimming pool area. Then, you can go down to the photo session area, where you will be asked to buy expensive portraits of yourself and companions with SkyPark background screen. Your tour ends then. (5) You can go back to Orchard Road by Bus 106, or you can spend more time at the lower levels of Tower 3, where there are numerous shops, restaurants, various attractions, and a casino. This visit is strongly recommended. [To visit the casino, you need to show your passport: There are separate entrances to the casino for locals and foreign passport holders. They will all end up being in the same casino after passing through the gate control sections. The only difference is: Locals have to pay admission charge, whereas foreigners don't pay admission charge] (6) To return to Orchard Road by public transportation, you have 2 choices. You can use MRT or Bus 106. MRT station is accessible from the lower level of the hotel. To ride Bus 106 back to Orchard Road, you will go to the opposite side of the bus stop where you got off before. This bus stop can be reached via the passage ways at the lower level. You can ask any attendants there for assistance. (7) Bus 106: You can board Bus 106, and get off at ""Winsland Hse"" stop on Penang Road which is parallel to Orchard Road.

_x000D_
I interviewed my Nana's neighbour a couple of decades ago, who was a Australian POW at the Changi prison who worked on the railway._x000D_
_x000D_
So this history has always been of interest._x000D_
_x000D_
I am unsure what i was expecting and for some reason may have expected more after reading up on the Changi prison and the Japanese exploits during the war._x000D_
_x000D_
The Museum is informative and worth a visit._x000D_
_x000D_
There is an area in the mock up chapel to light a candle in memory of loved ones and relatives who may have served or been a POW. So I paid tribute to Mr Gordon A Sutton QX14137 who helped me as a young teenager answer the questions I had about being a POW. A sense of closure and to remember him for his service and sacrifice._x000D_
_x000D_
Photos cannot be taken inside - I would have perhaps thought that the opportunity to take photos should be afforded given persons travel from afar to pay their respects. Whilst appreciating people visit to reflect and pause on the exploits of war and humanity, an opportunity to take some pics would have been appreciated._x000D_
_x000D_
There are also audio tours available for a charge to walk through the small Museum._x000D_
_x000D_
Need an hour at least to peruse the information boards etc on offer._x000D_

We visited via local tourism tours that can be booked. I perhaps was a little disappointed at the pricing and what was on offer at the museum._x000D_

98964,458415349,2017-02-10 00:00:00.000,1,Disappointed really,"I visited on a weekday with minimal crowd and felt underwhelmed. The exterior of the building was impressive and the media hype surrounding this museum when it first opened gave me a certain high expectation._x000D_
LKCNHM pales in comparison with Smithsonian Museum, British Natural History Museum or Vienna's Natural History Museum - these are really world class but It would be unfair to compare._x000D_
But the small size is not the factor for my low rating. The educational objective is what really matters - who is the target audience, what education level & what level of knowledge to impart. Currently it's neither here nor there._x000D_
I mean, this museum is probably good for local visitors or a local school's field trip. If I were a foreign tourist, I would feel this was a great waste of my precious time._x000D_
The 3 dinosaur fossils, acquired at a substantial cost, were too lightly treated or dumbed down. More information could be shared around the exhibit - their life, diet, predator, locomotion etc. Berlin Natural History Museum did a good job with their fossil of a T-Rex. Oh, one more thing, the dinosaurs 'light show' was a total farce. As one of the world's top universities, NUS could surely do better._x000D_
Similarly the sperm whale skeleton is accompanied with barely there information about these magnificent mammals - how & what they feed on, their reproduction, how human impact their population, how whalers exploit them etc._x000D_
On the positive side, I applaud LKCNHM's effort to focus on Singapore and regional biodiversity. There is relevance in the way of story telling in order to impart knowledge or to pique curiosity. The small Heritage Gallery featuring collections from the original Raffles Museum is nicely presented._x000D_

93923,589936005,2018-06-23 00:00:00.000,5,Wind Walkers Exhibition,"I visited the Wind Walkers exhibition featuring Theo JansenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Strandbeests on its opening day. The Insights Tour led by Theo Jansen in the opening weekend was exciting and insightful. He shared about how his Ã¢â‚¬Å“beach animalsÃ¢â‚¬Â were made of PVC tubes, cable ties, recycled plastic bottles, and sails; they could walk when pulled or blown by the wind. Among the 13 Strandbeests on display, we could have a go at pulling 2 of them. Visitors could also view other Strandbeests in action during the reanimation tours held several times a day. By the afternoon, several Strandbeests needed repairing, but this was understandable since the Strandbeests on display were fragile Ã¢â‚¬Å“fossilsÃ¢â‚¬Â that no longer functioned as well. There was also a little crafting corner, though I wished the crafts could have been more closely related to the exhibition (e.g. making a mini leg). I think this exhibition is well worth a visit if you have seen and been curious about the Strandbeests, or have a deep interest in subjects like physics, mathematics, and the arts. Do visit the ArtScience Museum official website when planning your visit to include a guided tour and/or reanimation tour. From now till 30 June 2018, 1-for-1 single exhibition tickets are available for the Wind Walkers exhibition._x000D_

77496,651211720,2019-02-10 00:00:00.000,5,An unusual and enchanting night zoo experience,"As newcomers to Singapore we figured we'd be visiting the zoo a lot, our daughter is mad keen on animals and we expect visitors will want to go so we have bought the annual pass which covers all four of the Singapore Zoo attractions; The Zoo, The River Safari, The Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park. This review covers the Night Safari only._x000D_
_x000D_
The night safari opens at 7:15 pm each evening and is open till midnight. It offers the visitor the choice of a tram ride through the park or a walk through the park. Be aware that you need to book your tram ride time slot in advance._x000D_
_x000D_
The tram ride is a good opening gambit as the ride quietly guides you past each of the enclosures with a slowdown or a stop at each to get a look at the animals, with the driver giving a running commentary about the animals, their behaviour and their habitat. There is dim lighting available at each location to enable you to see the animals but photography is pretty much a lost cause and flash photography is completely forbidden. That said there is always some dipstick who will attempt to Ã¢â‚¬Å“sneakÃ¢â‚¬Â a flash photo in._x000D_
_x000D_
The tram ride does allow you to alight at a couple of intermediate stops to get a closer look at the animal enclosures adjacent to the tram stop. You can then try to join the next available tram or walk back._x000D_
_x000D_
The walk through the night safari takes you through distinct zones and allows you to see exhibits and enclosures you cannot see from the tram as well as take a closer look at the enclosures you can see from the tram. The Lion feeding is particularly good to watch._x000D_
_x000D_
The main tram station also has a wide selection of food and beverage options and as with the main zoo, the local cuisine is excellent.",2019-01-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-30 14:44:37.211,Fly-Boy-Rez,Singapore,Night Safari,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",newcomer singapore figure would visit zoo lot daughter mad keen animal expect visitor want go bought annual pas cover four singapore zoo attraction zoo river safari night safari jurong bird park review cover night safari onlyxd xd night safari open pm even open till midnight offer visitor choice tram ride park walk park aware need book tram ride time slot advancexd xd tram ride good opening gambit ride quietly guide past enclosure slowdown stop get look animal driver give run commentary animal behaviour habitat dim light available location enable see animal photography pretty much lose cause flash photography completely forbidden say always dipstick attempt asneaka flash photo inxd xd tram ride allow alight couple intermediate stop get closer look animal enclosure adjacent tram stop try join next available tram walk backxd xd walk night safari take distinct zone allows see exhibit enclosure can not see tram well take closer look enclosure see tram lion feed particularly good watchxd xd main tram station also wide selection food beverage option main zoo local cuisine excellent,Interaction with Animals

Amazing zoo, everything logistically makes sense and an easy way to spend a day. The waterpark area was closed for this week for maintenance which was a bummer as kids really looking forward to it but alas - at least we know it's cleaned and maintained regularly! The tram is a great addition, the animals all seem well cared for, pretty free range and naturally happy unlike other zoos where animals are caged and dismal. I would highly recommend this zoo!_x000D_
HOWEVER, under no circumstances should you waste your money to book a tour (we booked the zoo + the orangutan breakfast with free transfer included on this tripadvisor page through their new travel branch - Viator. So long as Viator is using this ""Tour Asia East"" company stay far away. Not only is this company unprofessional, late, disrespectful and unknowledgeable but because they are simply subcontracted by Viator - nobody is accountable or responsible for anything that goes wrong with your tour (and, trust me, lots will go wrong). From being late (and therefore, missing 80% of the breakfast time) to not servicing 80% of the main Singapore hotels, there's no reason for this Tour Asia to be in business. And, the fact that Viator wasn't available (even though they boast 24/7 service) to help me was unacceptable.

I would recommend that not riding the trams but rather walking the well-marked trails as you will have a much better chance of seeing the animals.

Do not bring a camera with you for the Night Safari unless you have a very high end camera with a tripod for taking nighttime photos with no flash as flash photography is not allowed; however, many visitors do use a flash resulting in poor photos and blinding the rest of us on the tours._x000D_

81216,562059714,2018-02-22 00:00:00.000,5,Escape the madness,"A great way to escape the madness of Singapore City. The Southern Ridges are a series of interconnected walks along a ridge west of Singapore City, looking out over the straits._x000D_
_x000D_
The walk starts at HarbourFront MRT, where you can either walk up the Marang Trail into Mount Faber park - you can also get a cable car from Sentosa. Great views of the city and the straits. You can get something to eat and drink at the Jewel Box. From Mount Faber, walking west, you gently climb up to Henderson Waves, and then into Telok Blangah Park, which has a collection of large trees set around private residences._x000D_
_x000D_
Then onto the Forest Walk, which is 1.3km of raised metal walkway, taking you through the treetops. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s warnings of monkeys and snakes, but we never saw any. This section is really spectacular, and definitely recommended. Going west it gently slopes down; it might be hard work going east._x000D_
_x000D_
After Alexandra Arch, the trail goes into the more formal HortPark, which you could spend up to a couple of hours in if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested in plants. Finally, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s another elevated section - Canopy Walk - and then you can walk down to Science Park Drive and get the bus to Kent Ridge MRT. We missed out this bit, taking a bus back from Alexandra Road. (Google Maps is good for bus times and planning). Buses are good as you get to see various parts of the city you wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t normally visit._x000D_
_x000D_
This was really enjoyable, and a contrast to the rest of Singapore, but we werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t prepared for walking in the hot, humid atmosphere. The whole Southern Ridges walk is only 10km, which shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been a problem for us, but we ran out of time (and water!). It takes far longer than in cooler climes - so do allow plenty of time, and take plenty of water._x000D_

It is also a welcome breath of fresh air with its wide selection of Southeast Asian art. Don't get me wrong, I like the European old masters as much as anyone, but the selection here offers genuine new vistas for the western traveler, and such is always welcome._x000D_

There is a selection of different galleries within the building with different exhibitions, so you get to enjoy a broad selection of different styles, approaches, methods and materials. You definitely won't get bored with this kind of variety._x000D_

_x000D_
1. A walk that is named and divided by areas: Mekong River, Ganges River, Nile River. Sea creatures from these rivers are kept in aquariums accordingly. My favourite was the alligator in Ganges River! I will attach a pic of my sister standing with the alligator below. Also, along this walk, you will be going through Panda Forest. One red panda, 2 giant pandas, Kai Kai and Jia Jia. They were lovely! I was fascinated by the Red Panda so much! We only managed to see one giant panda as the other was sleeping_x000D_
_x000D_
2. River Cruise. Be reminded that you need to purchase an extra ticket at SGD5 per adult for this trip. It is a 15 minute boat ride on the river, and if you are lucky, you may get to see giraffes and elephants from Singapore Zoo in this ride. We only managed to see giraffes._x000D_
_x000D_
3. Amazon Ride. This will cost another additional SGD5 per adult. Young children are not allowed on this ride. You are made to sit in a boat like thing that goes on a water track, very much like water rides in a theme park. You get to see different kind of animals along this ride, and again if you are lucky, you can spot jaguars on this ride. This ride is about 15 minutes as well._x000D_

Enjoy the leaf-litter communities at both sides as you go up. You're rewarded with a wonderful view of Sentosa and the cable cars once you reach the top of the stairs with the boat-like structure. A kind of Singapore hanam is visible on the treetops but I stead of cherry blossom you have local flowers. The vegetation is lush with colorful flowers, even bamboo and angsana in their pods as you walk on the sturdy steel path at the same height as the treetops. Looking down into the valley as you exit Henderson, you see banana trees and plenty of foliage. Colourful boards provide useful botanical information and pictures of birds you can spot if you're lucky. We saw one monkey, boldly resting against the rail and scratching his vitals but it was well-behaved and didn't attempt to snatch anything but we kept our distance, obeying the warnings posted everywhere._x000D_

It could have well been short due to the fact that we saw very few animals and those that we did see were so far away, the tram stops for very short periods to view and then moves on whether we are ready or not._x000D_

There are walks to be taken through some of the enclosures and again due to my wifes walking issues we were unable to avail ourselves of these so cannot comment._x000D_

As soon as you arrived, buy the ticket because if you wait, there will be more people. The ticket price for adult cost about 28 Singapore Dollars and for kid cost about 15 Singapore Dollars. The ticket is for visiting 2 places, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest._x000D_
_x000D_
You should also buy the shuttle bus ticket because if you walk, your legs might hurt. The ticket cost about 2 Singapore Dollars and you can use it two times. It may seem a little expensive, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth it._x000D_
_x000D_
I recommend you to visit the Flower Dome first so you can learn about many plants species. The Flower Dome contains diverse species of plant and some can be found in the picture that I had attached below._x000D_
_x000D_
One cons of the dome is that, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s kind of smelly. Some plants would dried up and cause the smell to form. If you are plan on taking your kids, you might consider asking them if they are fine with the smell because itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite strong._x000D_
_x000D_
The next stop is the Cloud Forest. The Cloud Forest contains less type of plants but, in my opinion, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better than the Flower Dome. When you enter the Cloud Forest, you would see a huge waterfall. There would be water vapor in the air and that would freshen you._x000D_
_x000D_
Then you can use the elevator to go to the top. When you reached the top, you can walk on the walkway and learned about the species of plants that are grown in tropical highlands. You would feel like walking through the cloud._x000D_

76393,695798690,2019-08-05 00:00:00.000,3,"Nice well-maintained zoo, very poor queue management","I want to give this place a higher rating but they definitely need to improve their queue management. We bought tickets via Klook but it took us almost an hour to enter after they've opened the gates - the queue was very long (our tickets were for the 8:15 PM entry). We were supposed to line up for the tram but after being in line for several minutes and seeing how long the queue was, my husband decided that we should just do the walking trail. This turned out to be a good decision. This allowed us to go around the park and see the animals up close. The zoo seems well maintained and has a good selection of animals - very enjoyable particularly for young kids. We brought a stroller for our 5 year old son, so we were able to move him around quickly when he would tire from walking. While we enjoyed the walking trail, I was also concerned during this time if we will be able to catch the tram and see the show before the night was over. After going around for almost an hour to complete the walking trail, we were able to line up fairly quickly for the tram ride. At this time though, we had already missed the creatures of the night show (930 PM show) and the park was nearing closing time (already past 10 PM). From our experience, if you enter at 815 PM, you will not be able to see all the attractions - in our case, we just did the walking trail and tram but missed the show. The zoo needs to manage their queues better, maybe limit the tickets sold so their guests can still get a good solid experience and not feel like they need to be rushing to cover the entire place and enjoy all the attractions.

This is actually a place that you get to see the interaction between locals and international visitors. One amazing feat about this Barrage is that there's hardly any mosquitoes day and night, and that such a small place is able to process water for three quarter of the island's population. It's truly an amazing feat. Should you have a bike, there's a new trail that enables you to cycle all the way to East Coast.

87145,417787188,2016-09-13 00:00:00.000,5,"Well designed park, almost all animals were visible","We spent a great day at the zoo, it took app. 6 hours to view the whole thing. I'm probably a slow visitor, who enjoys watching the animals in a leisurely pace. It's definitely the best of the ""traditional"" zoos I have visited so far, with good habitats where the animals are visible and free ranging non-dangerous animals (e.g. small monkeys). I highly recommend it to people who spend lots of time in Singapore, or to people on short visits who have been to few or no zoos before (and would like to see some animals). Of the 4 animals parks in Singapore I actually only rank it no. 3 (Night Safari and River Safari surpassing it), because I find it a bit big (compared to the River Safari), and because I have seen many of the animals before (both River and Night Safari having non-traditional animals), but it is definitely worth a visit if you have the time! You can buy a 4-park hopper ticket to experience all the parks (one entry per park valid for 7days) or you can buy a 2-park ticket where you can choose which parks to visit. Make sure to bring a water bottle, as the park has water stations to fill it up. We had lunch at Ah Meng and they had a wide selection of cuisines (western, Chinese, Indian etc.) and was not wildly expensive (app. 12$ per dish). The grey kangaroo habitat was amazing: when we were there the kangaroo crossed the walking path right between a bunch of people to get to the shaded side, so cute! Also the polar bear was impressive, it's so huge! A lot of people were also hanging out there to enjoy the AC. The white tiger is definitely also worth a visit, it's beautiful. And the Borneoan Orangutan was so cool, it apparently often sits in it's favorite spot which is right up against the glass, looking out at people. The zoo offers a free shuttle service to (and I assume from) Khatib MRT station (red line), but it may only be on Sunday's and public holidays. All in all a day well spent, and worth the price (we bought the 4-park ticket, which will save you 50% of single ticket prices, in addition if you buy the ticket online you save another 10%).",2016-09-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-26 12:52:30.914,lisalH7223LI,Denmark,Singapore Zoo,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",spent great day zoo take app hour view whole thing probably slow visitor enjoys watch animal leisurely pace definitely best traditional zoo visit far good habitat animal visible free range non dangerous animal eg small monkey highly recommend people spend lot time singapore people short visit zoo would like see animal animal park singapore actually rank night safari river safari surpass find bit big compare river safari see many animal river night safari non traditional animal definitely worth visit time buy park hopper ticket experience park one entry per park valid day buy park ticket choose park visit make sure bring water bottle park water station fill lunch ah meng wide selection cuisine western chinese indian etc not wildly expensive app per dish grey kangaroo habitat amaze kangaroo cross walk path right bunch people get shade side cute also polar bear impressive huge lot people also hang enjoy ac white tiger definitely also worth visit beautiful borneoan orangutan cool apparently often sits favorite spot right glass look people zoo offer free shuttle service assume khatib mrt station red line may sunday public holiday day well spent worth price bought park ticket save single ticket price addition buy ticket online save another,Interaction with Animals

We thought that we would also pay a visit to the night safari having been to the Singapore Zoo previously during the day and really enjoyed ourselves. This outstanding institution is at the vanguard of animal conservation, and particularly of the many endangered primates in this part of the world._x000D_
_x000D_
However, I can only describe our interaction with the night safari as an unmitigated disaster and an almost complete waste of $100. Things began well enough, we booked an online tour with City Tours figuring this would be the easiest way to get out to the zoo from where we are staying on Orchard Road. This was simple enough, and we had a good start with the shuttle van collecting us promptly at 5:45pm. We spent the next 40 minutes weaving our way through various neighbourhoods, stopping and waiting for patrons who never bothered to turn up. Eventually, we got down to the Singapore Flyer at 6:20pm. This seems like a long ride,but then we waited another 15 minutes for a shuttle driver to arrive and collect the 8 of us who had bothered to turn up._x000D_

Here began yet a stranger odyssey as, despite having a full van, we weaved our way through downtown streets stopping at two more hotels, where our second driver disembarked and engaged in animated discussions with staff at these hotels after which he returned to the car and eventually got us on the PIE to Lake Mandai. I have no idea way we made these stops,though it cost us another 20 minutes in delays, and I found it most amusing the fellow who was accosted at the last hotel seemed to be the doorman who was dressed in such an outrageous tuxedo and bow tie that I thought he was an extra from a Jackie Chan movie. It takes a debt collector to know a debt collector and my suspicion is that if some bills aren't paid soon, then someone is going to have a very bad day indeed!_x000D_
_x000D_
Back to tho zoo. We eventually got there at 7:40, two hours after leaving the hotel. Here we waited another 40 minutes with other irate customers in line 4 of the ticketing window to redeem our on-line ticket, which wasn't really a ticket but a voucher for a ticket that could only be redeemed for an available show ticket. So despite having ""tickets"" for the 7:30 tour we wound up with tickets to the 9:15 admission. The length of the queue to enter was astounding. You would have thought that it was an exodus from some war torn hell hole._x000D_
_x000D_
This left us both speechless as we needed to be back on the bus home by 9:45 for the reverse two hour trip. I noted that we were not alone in our frustration. So we had an ice cream, kissed our $100 good bye and considered it a donation to the poor inmates, and walked down to catch a cab, which had us back on Orchard road in twenty minutes. It was the worst experience that we have ever had here and the most uncharacteristic. We can't recommend the night safari or city tours to anyone. My next safari will by to watch Tarzan in the theatre. At least I might actually get in to the theatre._x000D_

We went on a Wednesday where it wasn't crowded nor too noisy. Even tho he map is huge but easy to navigate and there are Trams going in 4 stops cycle around the zoo. Tram tix cost $5/adult and $3/child and once bought, can be used unlimitedly. There are lots of things to see everywhere. The animals were spectacular just being themselves. A word of advice though is to get the mosquito patch for yourselves and especially your kids. You can get it from the shop at the entrance; just one sticker will do for that whole journey. For corporate cards and members, don't forget to show your card at any F&B and retail outlets to enjoy 20% off. It's really a good deal. There is a Kids area where there is a huge waterpark; really lovely but my nieces didnt bring extra clothes. Pony rides and Carousel are seen nearby and they can feed the goats for free. Somewhere nearby there is a rabbit house where you can see rabbits and guinea pigs in big caged playgrounds. Not sure when is the timing for the rabbit show, they didnt state. For timings of feeding, there are many signboards all around the zoo around each exhibit that allows people to see the animals being fed. For the showtimes, there are currently 4 shows and it's a good thing that the timings are roughly in a 1 hour or 1.5 hour gap so that we can walk over to the next one in time and yes, even tho the map is big but the shows are in a cluster so you dont have to run and travel everywhere.

20564,561269951,2018-02-18 00:00:00.000,3,The whole experience was a bit meh :/,"Guys I apologise in advance, my review might sound a bit negative for some of you given the amazing trip adviser rating for this attraction on this site. I am trying to remain unbiased during writing this review but I do need to highlight how miserable my day was probably due to some bad decisions I made along the way. So first and foremost if this is the first time you are getting on a cable car then yeah you will definitely like it. But bear in mind the ride is short... like really really short it kindda finishes before it starts. They will try to make you share the cable car with others and can fit upto 8 people in one cable car! Tried to do fit 6 passengers and a buggy with us during one of our journey. It was the most uncomfortable 3/4 mins ride in the 30 degrees heat. There is no aircon so yeah be prepared to be steamed in the heat. Although i must mention there were some weak air ventilation. If you are the second group on-boarding the cars you are most certainly going to be sitting facing the opposite direction of travel and going to miss the view. If thats ok with you considering the bucks you will be paying then yeah these are no big deal. Now the big mistake I made that ruined my day...i bought cable car return tickets from my hotel concierge, trying to be clever and avoid long queues but didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t realise this was actually voucher and not tickets. So when I went to the cable car station they sent us to the monorail office to collect tickets. This was about 20 mins walk through two shopping malls, then another 10 mins queue to redeem the tickets from the desk then 15 mins walk back to the harbourfront station. I would recommend you buy the tickets directly from the station and avoid all the extra hassle if you can. Now somehow while getting back to the station I lost my tickets, must have dropped somewhere, this never happened to me before. I went to the ticket desk to ask if they can help me in this situation, they basically told me to bugger off! Spoke to the tour company who issued the vouchers they werenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t helpful either. I was really surprised a big company like sentosa doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any system in place to assist genuine customers in this kind of situation. I had all my other papers with me showing i paid etc. How difficult was it for them to track and ticket they issued against the vouchers and block it and reissue new ones. No idea!

_x000D_
Gardens by the Bay is the newest attraction in Singapore, and it is definitely worth it for tourists to visit. Opened just a little more than four years ago, this outdoor recreation and leisure destination boasts a 54 hectares footprint. The setting is that of a garden in a downtown area near the new Marina Bay financial district. It comprises a horticultural themed area centred round Singapore's multiracial heritage (Colonial, Malay, Chinese and Indian Gardens), Supertree structures and a ubiquitous learning and discovery spaces. These are free of charge. The other three sections, namely the OCBC Skyway and the two conservatories (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) are ticketed. It costs $28 for entry to the two conservatories and $8 for the OCBC Skyway. The Flower Dome is home to themed exhibits throughout the year. So far, I have visited the Tulipmania (April to May) and the Orchid Extravaganza (July). The orchid display is part of the annual Singapore Garden Festival held in the last week of July. Some orchid displays continue to be exhibited through August as part of the celebrations for the National Day._x000D_
_x000D_
Gardens by the Bay is accessible by buses and train (MRT), preferably by train. The nearest MRT station is Bayfront. But be warned, the long walk to the Gardens takes about 20 to 25 minutes. In 2021, the Gardens will have a MRT station at its doorsteps. If arriving by car, the car park is near the free areas. It would take 5 to 10 minutes to walk to the conservatories. Car parking can be limited during the special displays periods. If cost is not a problem, my suggestion is to take a taxi. It might even be cheaper than parking the car, which costs $1.50 per hour for the first 5 hours, the rate being doubled thereafter. You would need to spend the whole day there if you intend to visit everything.",2016-07-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-25 18:38:22.298,AlanTham,Singapore,Gardens by the Bay,Leisure & Recreation,"18 Marina Gardens Drive | Bayfront Plaza, Singapore 018953, Singapore",write review local travel many part world hence qualify make comparisonsxd xd garden bay new attraction singapore definitely worth tourist visit open little four year ago outdoor recreation leisure destination boast hectare footprint set garden downtown area near new marina bay financial district comprises horticultural theme area centre round singapore multiracial heritage colonial malay chinese indian garden supertree structure ubiquitous learn discovery space free charge three section namely ocbc skyway two conservatory flower dome cloud forest ticket cost entry two conservatory ocbc skyway flower dome home theme exhibit throughout year far visit tulipmania april may orchid extravaganza july orchid display part annual singapore garden festival held last week july orchid display continue exhibit august part celebration national dayxd xd garden bay accessible bus train mrt preferably train near mrt station bayfront warn long walk garden take minute garden mrt station doorstep arrive car car park near free area would take minute walk conservatory car parking limited special display period cost not problem suggestion take taxi might even cheaper parking car cost per hour first hour rate double thereafter would need spend whole day intend visit everything,Garden Tour

If you have a weekend free in Singapore, I highly recommend getting the 4 in 1 parkhopper special (includes admission to Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park). This way you save up to 50% on ticket prices than if you had purchased them all individually. You could probably explore Singapore Zoo in the morning when it's less crowded, then head to the River Safari in the afternoon followed by the Night Safari in the evening. Jurong Bird Park would need to be done the following day as it's far away from Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari, which are all clustered together in the same area._x000D_

You will need at least 3 hours at Singapore Zoo to be able to explore the whole place at a leisurely pace and to be able to attend some of the animal shows. The show with the sea lion was lots of fun to watch! Keep an eye out for their lovely polar bear as well. Definitely bring some water and snacks with you as it's rather expensive to buy food and drink around the zoo. Sensible walking shoes and a mosquito repellent are must-haves as well!

There is a hawker market with lots of variety at Satay by the Bay - a short walk away from the Domes and worthwhile for a cheap and tasty lunch.,2018-12-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-25 14:46:02.551,JanKofMelbourne,Australia,Gardens by the Bay,Leisure & Recreation,"18 Marina Gardens Drive | Bayfront Plaza, Singapore 018953, Singapore",garden bay unique walk around supertrees worth adult elevate view garden conservatory functionally brilliant architecturally interest parkland lovely wander christmas display flower dome bit tacky view present would recommend cloud dome save money want visit one also cooler temperature wise although humid full beautiful plant hawker market lot variety satay bay short walk away dome worthwhile cheap tasty lunch,Garden Tour

On 11th February. we boarded Singapore Flayer. Some of our members were reluctant to board because of its rotation to a height of about 164 meters But once we were in, they had the last laugh. Experience of a life time._x000D_
_x000D_
The Singapore Flyer is a giant Ferris wheel in Singapore. Its a just coincidence that we were in the Flayer on 11th February 2016, when we were told that the Flayer carried its first paying passengers on 11 February 2008 but was opened to the public on 1 March 2008 and was officially opened on 15 April.2008._x000D_
_x000D_
The Flayer has 28 air-conditioned capsules, each able to accommodate 28 passengers As we were 12 members, we occupied a separate Capsule and enjoyed every minute of our stay inside the capsule. It was fantastic as we could see the entire City of Singapore from all angles and from all directions. We played, we laughted and enjoyed to the maximum extent._x000D_

95850,541473899,2017-11-17 00:00:00.000,5,Oldest Hindu temple in Singapore ... absolutely beautiful.,"Visited here in November 2017 whilst on holiday in Singapore. It is a beautiful temple, both the exterior and the interior which has many statues and sculptures. Removal of footwear is required before entering and modest dress ( covering of shoulders and no shorts) necessary.

Orchard Road is basically a long chain of shopping malls which are able to cater to a wide range of budgets, from your mass produced Uniqlo or H&M everyday clothing, all the way to your Louis Vuitton designer handbag. Because competition is very intense here, shopping malls often undergo renovation and changes often, so you may see a different look every time you come down to Orchard Road._x000D_
_x000D_
Even if you are not there to shop, even window shopping can be a good exercise to spend a few hours there with. However, in my opinion, Orchard Road is one of the few places in Singapore to do some great street photography. For the street photographer out there, this will be a sort of a paradise to get that gritty street angle feel. During weekends and public holidays, people will tend to dress better when going to Orchard Road._x000D_

If you are feeling tired and hungry from all that walking, there are plenty of food choices everywhere, and of course, do not forget to get some ice cream from the mobile ice cream stalls all along the pedestrian pavement that will provide some respite from the heat._x000D_

Things to bring : A tiny map light to read the map in the dark, a handheld fan, bottles of drinking water._x000D_

88104,390881882,2016-07-10 00:00:00.000,5,Fantastic Experience- a must do in Singapore!,"My husband and I visited the night safari, it is by far one of the best things to do in Singapore. We took the MRT to Ang Mo Kio station, then took the 138 bus which stopped right outside the Night Safari, River Safari and the Singapore Zoo entrances. We went without a ticket which in hindsight was maybe a mistake. There are 3 different admission times 7.15, 8.15 and 9.15. When we arrived the 7.15 admission time was fully booked so had to go for the 8.15 time. This meant we had to wait before we could go into the actual safari. Outside the safari are a couple of fast food areas and shops to browse through. They did also give us a free pass into the river safari as currently a lot of the sites were closed for renovation. It was still pretty good to see the manatees that they have there, but no boat ride unfortunately. As soon as 8.15 came you were let into the park and could either go by tram around the park or walk. As there was a big queue for the tram we decided to walk around. This was brilliant! Obviously it is very dark and spotting the animals is half the fun but walking around felt so much more of a natural experience. The Asian otters were particularly cute, being able to hear them before you could see them. The bat enclosure was also very good although not for the feint hearted. We walked halfway around, then jumped on the tram to experience the elephants, Rhinos and the other larger animals that aren't accessible by walking. We got back to the beginning and jumped on to see the first half again but on the tram. Then at halfway hopped off and walked the final bit which consisted of hyenas, Tigers and flying squirrels._x000D_
The tram took approximately 40 mins with the second half of the trip taking most of that chunk. If you wanted to walk only part of the safari, it would definitely have to be the first half. There are four trails, 2 for each half of the safari. It took us half an hour for each trail but could easily be done in 15 minutes. We finished everything at 11 but missed the show! My advice would be to buy a ticket beforehand for the 7.15 admission so you have a longer time going around all the animals.",2016-07-01 00:00:00.000,Couples,2020-01-30 15:37:30.918,JadeHodson,United Kingdom,Night Safari,Nature & Wildlife,"80 Mandai Lake Road, Singapore 729826, Singapore",husband visit night safari far one best thing singapore take mrt ang mo kio station take bus stop right outside night safari river safari singapore zoo entrance go without ticket hindsight maybe mistake different admission time arrive admission time fully book go time meant wait could go actual safari outside safari couple fast food area shop browse also give u free pas river safari currently lot site close renovation still pretty good see manatee boat ride unfortunately soon come let park could either go tram around park walk big queue tram decide walk around brilliant obviously dark spot animal half fun walk around felt much natural experience asian otter particularly cute able hear could see bat enclosure also good although not feint hearted walk halfway around jumped tram experience elephant rhino large animal not accessible walk get back begin jumped see first half tram halfway hopped walk final bit consist hyena tiger fly squirrelsxd tram take approximately min second half trip take chunk want walk part safari would definitely first half four trail half safari take u half hour trail could easily do minute finish everything miss show advice would buy ticket beforehand admission longer time go around animal,Interaction with Animals

We decided to go to the Botanic Gardens as it was a short taxi ride away from our hotel in Robertson Quay.The Gardens are not designed to be a tourist attraction, it is where locals go for their picnic, jog/walk/stroll or just a day out with nature.But there are parts of the gardens where you find more tourists than locals (the National Orchid Gardens for one). Be prepared to walk (a good walking shoe would help) and also carry water and food. There are many lovely areas where you could do a quick picnic. The trees look spectacular and many of them very old (60+ years). The swan lake is pretty with an interesting stone sculpture in the middle. The National Orchid Gardens charges a fee for foreigners and seemed to be the photographers' favourite. It is undoubtedly very beautiful, though i expected a little more flowers. We did not plan our trip very well, so we just walked as we pleased for a little more than 2 hours with some breaks in between. But there are attractions within the gardens, which could be more interesting for children (my 6 year old wasn't too pleased with all the walking and looking at trees!). These close early and hence it is better to plan the visit. Nevertheless, i loved the gardens and it is definitely a good stop to admire nature at its best (and also to avoid the crowds at all the other regular tourist attractions).",2017-12-01 00:00:00.000,Family,2020-01-26 09:53:11.239,ShubaKrishnan,Malaysia,Singapore Botanic Gardens,Leisure & Recreation,"1 Cluny Road, Singapore 259 569, Singapore",want something light first day singapore reach long bus ride kl couple hour spare decide go botanic garden short taxi ride away hotel robertson quaythe garden not design tourist attraction local go picnic jogwalkstroll day naturebut part garden find tourist local national orchid garden one prepared walk good walk shoe would help also carry water food many lovely area could quick picnic tree look spectacular many old year swan lake pretty interest stone sculpture middle national orchid garden charge fee foreigner seem photographer favourite undoubtedly beautiful though expect little flower not plan trip well walk pleased little hour break attraction within garden could interest child year old not pleased walk look tree close early hence well plan visit nevertheless love garden definitely good stop admire nature best also avoid crowd regular tourist attraction,Garden Tour

The historical significance emerges as you pass the cannon and figurines of soldiers with their artillery as it was in the defence of the island against theJapanese in the Pacific War. There's even a tunnel where artillery was stored.._x000D_
Further up it's the waterfront where you can see boats, container ships and the cable cars above. Unfortunately there are picnic grounds with barbecue pots resembling East Coast Park which mar the natural surroundings. Hopefully the groups which make use of them clear their refuse as we could see large numbers of plastic wrappers, bottles etc floating in the sea at the breakwater near where people were fishing (thought this wasn't allowed?)_x000D_
The boardwalk was good, passing a green mangrove pool, very picturesque, and delightfully, we saw a monitor lizard in the leaf litter, four monkeys on the rail of the boardwalk and a family of hens and chickens, a couple of squirrels._x000D_

77532,649766998,2019-02-03 00:00:00.000,4,Great half-day,"Even though we went to Singapore Zoo on a Saturday and the place was packed with children, the Zoo is large enough to offer everybody an amazing time. We took a Grab (the most popular transport application in South East Asia), with a very good cost of 19 SGD (Singapore Dollars), considering that the Zoo is pretty far away from the city center. For the return we decided to take a shuttle which takes you directly to a MRT station, for only 1 SGD. The shuttle station is right in front of the Zoo entrance so it canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be missed. The Zoo itself is great and indeed itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a must-see, not only for the animals, but also for the charming park, with lots of vegetation and entertaining pavillions. I just loved the dragon themed zone, related to Game of Thrones, right at the entrance. There are plenty of food choices inside the Zoo, so you could definetely spend a whole day inside. Seeing how Singapore, the city of the future itself looks like, I would have expected a bit more technology put in the way the information about the animals is provided, the best example would be the screen that shows you how a piton detects its prey, by measuring the body temperature of the visitors walking in front if the screen. Brilliant! There is a mini-bus inside the Zoo, which takes the visitors from one place to another, but you can skip it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s an extra 5 SGD and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no fun. It should be free for all visitors. Buy an online ticket, you can avoid long queues, especially if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going on a weekend day.

It is worth going to Singapore just to go to the gardens. Although the big enclosed domes are the highlight the surrounding, mostly tropical, gardens show the diversity of trees, palms and plants in a magnificent setting._x000D_
The flower dome has a huge array of plants, mostly in flower, from all over the world and is set out in countries and regions. The cloud rain forest dome is a little more specific as most of the plants are from higher altitude, cooler tropical area and has numerous more ""indoor"" types of plants. A large diverse array of orchards adds much of the colour in there along with gesneriads and other exotica._x000D_

_x000D_
It was interesting but could have been much better. Good historical focus - the kampong era with its floods and droughts to the fledgling country in the 60's and Lee Kwan Yew's inspiration to do away with the old and in with the new. In all he did - he did with passion - and that included cleaning up the Singapore and Kallang Rivers, then heavily polluted. The birth of reservoirs and the road to Singapore's water self sufficiency. In front of us were a group of Hong Kong secondary or college students so sat in on their presentation. Pleased I did as the mechanical model was fairly useless without an explanation. Moved on to the next room which dealt with reclamation - guide poorly presented the topic. Said reclamation started by pouring soil in and covering it with sea water - living here - I do hope not. Told the students reclamation was common in Singapore as opposed to Hong Kong - not so - they are experts in reclaiming from the sea too. For all her faults - I did learn how the barrage operates and some water management points._x000D_

If your tour individually it's not particularly stimulating, especially if your not based in Singapore or have a particular local interest. Nice views of the barrage from the roof and nice artwork in forecourt._x000D_

We then decided to visit Gardens by the Bay, expecting it to be a bit of fun but nothing much in terms of the botanicals side. To be fair, if you simply looked round the outdoor gardens, this would be true - the iconic tree structures are stunning and the trunks are all plant walls, but it's more the novelty and the design that's interesting; the heritage gardens and other small gardens are showing signs of neglect (assumption being that most guests are simply interested in the trees and the dome so they're not maintaining the smaller gardens). Regardless, the mini gardens are not worth specifically visiting, but the domes were something else altogether. The flower dome we spent hours in wandering around the meticulously maintained plants. The other dome was a huge plant wall which is all about the mass of the structure and the overall impression of the plants but is no less breathtaking._x000D_

Paid to go in the flower dome and cloud forest. They are currently having the orchid exhibition at the flower dome. Nice orchids but too limited in quantity in my opinion and it's mostly all concentrated in the middle of the dome on a one way traffic lane. Difficult to take pictures as you will be blocking the traffic flow. Everything has to be done quick. The other side of the flower dome is like a desert with just cactus exhibition. Cloud forest was basically just a mini forest with a giant waterfall at the entrance. There were a few fossils and glaciers monuments to look at the the ground level and also video clips on natural disasters I think. Too many people were packed at the video section so we decided to skip._x000D_
_x000D_
The positive side to these two domes is that they are both well air-conditioned and it was very nice to be inside. Nice change to the heat and humidity at the free zone outside. And you get to go in and out the domes as many times you want (within the day of ticket purchase). Just need to get a stamp on your wrist._x000D_
_x000D_
There is a little cafe/restaurant inside the flower dome. Did not get a chance to look at the menu and environment as they were having a private event when we were there._x000D_
